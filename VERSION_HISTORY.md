# Version History

## Version 1.7.0 (16 December 2025)

**Major conceptual clarification:**
- Added comprehensive "Routine Pharmacovigilance vs Enhanced Safety Monitoring" framework throughout document
- New Section 1.3: Detailed explanation of routine vs enhanced monitoring distinction with regulatory context
- Added "The Challenge of Black Box Governance for Private Citizens" methodology document addressing information asymmetry, epistemological challenges, and methodological constraints facing citizen auditors with limited investigative powers. This provides a theoretical framework and epistemological justification for audit scope, constraints, and reasoning approach—allowing main report to focus on findings rather than methodological defense.
- Enhanced Executive Summary with explicit scope clarification
- Updated Conclusion to reinforce assessment scope and significance
- Aligned README with main document framing

**Significance:** This version explicitly addresses potential misreading that the assessment claims "no monitoring occurred." The additions clarify that routine pharmacovigilance demonstrably occurred; the assessment examines whether the enhanced framework required under provisional approval conditions was systematically implemented and documented beyond routine operations.

**No changes to audit findings or evidence base.**
