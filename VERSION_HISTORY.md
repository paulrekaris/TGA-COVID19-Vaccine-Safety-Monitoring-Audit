# Version History

## Version 1.7.2 (19 December 2025)

- Add Phillips et al. (2021) peer-reviewed study documenting pre-rollout expert warnings.
  - Context: Study interviewed 17 Australian vaccine safety experts (July-October 2020) 
who identified data linkage as "major gap," characterized surveillance systems as 
"parallel systems," and recommended "significant enhancement" for COVID vaccines. 
Expert warnings align with subsequent TGA testimony that monitoring was "day-to-day 
processes" never "systematically tracked."
- Added primary-sources folder with Department of Health video transcript (3 February 2021) showing public messaging contradiction: DoH stated COVID monitoring "will be no different" from routine surveillance, same month TGA published 17-strategy enhanced Safety Plan. Enhanced README with "Public Communications vs Policy Commitments" section documenting day-one gap between public communications and formal Cabinet commitments. Repository restructured for clearer source documentation provenance.
- Restructured repository with professional folder organisation: created analysis/ folder for main audit documents (documentation gap analysis, presentation slides, FOI timeline), moved black-box-governance methodology to reference-documents/ folder, and created primary-sources/
- No changes to audit findings or evidence base.

## Version 1.7.1 (18 December 2025)

- Added an explicit definition of “black box governance” and integrated it into the methodological framing.
- Refined wording of government/TGA assurance statements to use accurate reported speech rather than implied verbatim quotes.
- Aligned the “Assurances Given to Australians” and “Why Documentation and Verification Matter” sections with the audit test: the existence (or absence) of systematic documentary evidence that Cabinet‑endorsed “enhanced safety monitoring” commitments were implemented as traceable processes.
- Added Commonwealth–state bilateral agreements context to demonstrate formal intergovernmental governance frameworks requiring systematic TGA safety monitoring.
- Enhanced FAQ: added Q32 on epistemological reasoning (deductive/abductive frameworks under incomplete evidence) and expanded Q35 personal statement with democratic accountability framing, including the formula “Transparency + Openness ⇒ Accountability ⇒ Trust.”
- Applied minor editorial and formatting improvements; corrected or updated links and directed readers to the relevant items in the /references folder.
- No changes to the underlying evidence base or audit findings.

## Version 1.7.0 (17 December 2025)

**Major Conceptual Clarification:**

- **Cabinet endorsement emphasis:** Strengthened framing throughout document to highlight that Cabinet endorsement elevated the Safety Monitoring Plan from TGA agency guidance to formal government commitment, establishing the 17 numbered strategies as a documented promise to Australian citizens and legal condition of provisional approval

- **Refined audit scope:** Clarified inquiry focuses on whether the Plan's 17 numbered strategies were implemented as distinct, systematically tracked processes with dedicated governance and audit trails, using the Plan's own framework as the verification standard

- **Added "The Challenge of Black Box Governance for Private Citizens" methodology document:** Addresses information asymmetry, epistemological challenges, and limited investigative powers facing citizen auditors under Australian law. Provides theoretical framework (Akerlof, Hayek, Popper, Lipton, O'Neill, Stiglitz, Arrow) justifying audit scope, constraints, and reasoning approach—allowing main report to focus on findings rather than methodological defence

- **Enhanced UTS teaching materials analysis:** Added full slide context (Slides 22-24) demonstrating gap between routine pharmacovigilance infrastructure presented in training and enhanced framework promised in Safety Plan

- **Updated Executive Summary and Conclusion:** Aligned with Cabinet commitment framing and clarified assessment scope

**Significance:** This version explicitly frames the audit question around verifiable implementation of Cabinet-endorsed commitments rather than engaging in routine vs enhanced definitional debate. The assessment acknowledges pharmacovigilance activities occurred; it examines whether the 17 strategies promised as conditions of provisional approval were implemented with the systematic documentation, governance, and audit trails necessary for independent accountability.

**No changes to audit findings or evidence base.**

## Version 1.5.0 (December 2025) - Major Update

**Substantive additions:**
- Provisional approval verification gap analysis – comprehensive examination of legislation, guidance, OAIC search results and AusPARs
- AusVaxSafety case study – detailed analysis of active surveillance performance and absence of documented TGA integration
