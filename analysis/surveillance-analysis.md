# TGA COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Reports: Comprehensive Surveillance Data Analysis

---

> ## Surveillance Data Analysis: Key Takeaways
> 
> **What This Analysis Documents:**
> 
> • **Extensive monitoring occurred but Plan framework invisible:** TGA collected 140,000+ DAEN reports, 3M+ AusVaxSafety responses, investigated 148 signals, and published 150+ safety reports across 33 months—yet zero Plan references appeared in any public report
> 
> • **Two major surveillance systems never reconciled:** DAEN passive reporting and AusVaxSafety active surveillance operated in parallel without documented integration methodology despite Plan Output 2.1 commitment to unified framework
> 
> • **Observable degradation from enhanced to routine:** Weekly detailed reports (2021) transitioned to fortnightly minimal summaries (2023) without documented assessment against provisional approval's enhanced monitoring requirements
> 
> • **"Expected rates" comparisons lack methodology:** Reports from mid-2022 onwards extensively used "rates similar to expected" reassurance language without publishing calculation methods, baseline sources, or statistical confidence intervals
> 
> • **International standards not met:** ICH E2E requires documented signal evaluation trails; WHO/EMA GVP IX requires signal disposition matrices; ANAO principles require performance tracking—none evidenced in published reports
> 
> • **FOI 4029-03 (ACV Mtg 25)** proves capacity: **weekly PRR/MaxSPRT** presented Sep 2021:** TGA presented Strategy 2.3 methodology materials to Advisory Committee on Vaccines (Sep 2021), demonstrating capacity to organise materials by Plan objectives—yet concurrent public reports contained zero Strategy 2.3 references

> • **OAIC search excluded advisory body evidence:** **Public reports exclude** ACV governance evidence (FOI 4029-03, D21-3141615) **despite** TGA Sep 2024 search (531 containers) admitting Obj 5 "unable to meaningfully interpret" Advisory Committee containers where FOI 4029-03 exists—**inadequate scope for Cabinet-endorsed policy verification**
> 
> • **Third-party verification confirms gaps:** FOI 5275 (Aug 2024, independent applicant) received response that TGA "does not hold incidence data" for AusPAR-specified monitoring conditions 3.5 years post-approval
> 
> • **Compensation barrier documented:** 148 signal investigations generated internal documentation but claimants cannot access this population-level evidence, contributing to 90-95% rejection rate among approximately 10,000 claims
> 
> • **Six reports systematically selected:** ISO 19011 sampling methodology ensures representative coverage across phases (enhanced/transition/routine), frequencies (weekly/biweekly/fortnightly), and timeline (first through final)
> 
> • **Complete archive preserved:** All 150+ reports maintained in National Library of Australia Trove and Internet Archive Wayback Machine enabling independent verification
> 
> • **ANAO performance principle violated:** "Performance information should enable assessment of whether outcomes achieved and outputs delivered as planned"—Plan's 20 outputs never tracked in public reports
> 
> • **Central finding validated:** Monitoring activities demonstrably occurred, but systematic documentation showing Plan functioned as operational accountability framework remains absent from accessible public records
> 
> **Standards Framework Applied:** ISO 19011:2018 (audit methodology), ANAO Better Practice Guide (performance information), ICH E2E (pharmacovigilance planning), WHO/EMA GVP Module IX (signal management)

## Selected Reports with Data Source Integration

| **Report Date** | **Phase** | **Frequency** | **DAEN Reports** | **Serious %** | **Key Signals** | **AusVaxSafety** | **Plan References** | **Link** |
|-----------------|-----------|---------------|------------------|---------------|-----------------|------------------|---------------------|----------|
| **3 Mar 2021** | Phase 1: Enhanced Initiation | Weekly | 3,908 reports documented following 1.4M doses administered nationally. | 11.2% of reports classified as serious adverse events. | Anaphylaxis emerged as primary signal requiring intensive investigation during initial rollout. | Medical visits tracked through active surveillance with systems being established. | Zero Plan references, zero Output 2.2 tracking, zero strategy linkage documented. | [Report](https://www.tga.gov.au/news/covid-19-vaccine-safety-reports/covid-19-vaccine-weekly-safety-report-3-march-2021) |
| **23 Dec 2021** | Phase 1: Peak Enhanced | Weekly | 87,000+ cumulative reports following 30M+ doses during peak national rollout. | 11.6% serious during peak enhanced monitoring representing maximum surveillance intensity. | Seven signals investigated: TTS, myocarditis, pericarditis, GBS, ITP, capillary leak, menstrual disorders. | 500,000+ survey responses collected providing population-level data independent of spontaneous reports. | Zero Plan references despite peak enhanced activities, zero output tracking, zero strategy documentation. | [Report](https://www.tga.gov.au/news/covid-19-vaccine-safety-reports/covid-19-vaccine-weekly-safety-report-23-12-2021) |

## Report Selection Methodology (ISO 19011 + ANAO Principles)

**ANAO Performance Information Principle Applied:** "Performance information should enable assessment of whether outcomes were achieved and outputs delivered as planned."

Six reports selected from 150+ corpus using systematic sampling criteria:

### 1. Temporal Coverage (ISO 19011 §6.3)

Six reports at 6-9 month intervals spanning complete 33-month period from initiation through cessation, providing sufficient granularity whilst avoiding redundancy.

### 2. Phase Representation

Two reports per phase: Enhanced (2021), Transition (2022), Routine (2023). Demonstrates observable surveillance intensity degradation over time.

### 3. Frequency Variation Documentation

Weekly (Reports 1-2), Biweekly (Report 3), Fortnightly (Reports 4-6) captures all publication formats documenting intensity reduction.

### 4. Strategic Milestone Capture

First report (baseline), peak rollout (maximum detail), transition points (format changes), final report (formal cessation) documents key programme inflection points.

### 5. Core Finding Validation

Each report independently validates zero Plan framework references across diverse phases, frequencies, and content types.

### Sample Size Justification

**Why six reports rather than four:**
Four reports insufficient for transition phase granularity and distinguishing emerging routine patterns versus established standardised formats.

**Why six reports rather than ten:**
Ten+ reports introduce redundancy without unique evidence value. Adjacent monthly reports within same phase contain substantially similar content without adding analytical value.

**Why these specific dates:**
Selected dates represent inflection points in surveillance characteristics rather than arbitrary calendar intervals. Each captures distinct characteristics not duplicated by adjacent reports.

## Critical Findings (ANAO + International Standards Framework)

### Finding 1: Absence of Documented Data Source Reconciliation

**ANAO Principle Applied:** "Performance information should be based on systems that can be replicated and produce consistent data over time."

TGA operated two major systems concurrently: DAEN passive (140,000+ reports) and AusVaxSafety active (3M+ responses). Reports reference both but provide no reconciliation methodology, integration framework, or unified analysis approach.

**ICH E2E Requirement:** "Signal detection should employ multiple data sources with documented integration methodology."

**Evidentiary Basis:** All six reports reference both systems without documenting how discrepancies resolved or outputs combined for signal detection.

**Implication:** Cannot verify Plan Output 2.1 (real-time active surveillance) functioned as implemented strategy versus aspirational commitment.

---

### Finding 2: Observable Surveillance Intensity Degradation

**ANAO Principle Applied:** "Performance reporting should enable assessment of whether planned activities were maintained throughout delivery period."

Systematic degradation documented across 33 months:
- **Enhanced (2021):** Weekly, detailed breakdowns, emerging signal investigations
- **Transition (2022):** Biweekly, "expected rates" without methodology, summary statements
- **Routine (2023):** Fortnightly, "no new concerns," minimal detail, legacy warnings only

**Temporal Correlation:** Aligns with FOI 4029-03 (Sep 2021 enhanced monitoring presentation to ACV) and Dascombe testimony (Oct 2025 "day-to-day processes").

**Implication:** Observable shift from enhanced to routine contradicts provisional approval requirement for enhanced monitoring throughout approval period.

---

### Finding 3: Unexplained "Expected Rates" Methodology Gap

**ICH E2E Requirement:** "Statistical methods for signal evaluation should be documented and transparent."

Reports from mid-2022 onwards employ "rates similar to expected" language extensively without publishing:
- Calculation methodologies
- Baseline data sources
- Statistical confidence intervals
- Whether incorporating enhanced monitoring or routine baselines

**Evidentiary Basis:** Reports 4-6 use this language as primary reassurance mechanism. Zero reports document methodology.

**Implication:** Cannot verify if comparisons incorporated Plan Strategy 2.3 (AIR-denominator analysis) or routine surveillance baselines.

---

### Finding 4: Zero Plan Framework References

**ANAO Principle Applied:** "Performance information should enable tracking against published strategies and frameworks."

Systematic review reveals across 150+ reports spanning 33 months:
- Zero Plan references as organising framework
- Zero Output 2.2 tracking (despite reports being Output 2.2 deliverables)
- Zero Strategy 2.3 outputs in public reports **despite ACV presentation** (FOI 4029-03, 29 Sep 2021): weekly PRR≥1/cases≥2 + MaxSPRT adoption
- Zero assessment of Plan delivery status at cessation

**Evidence of Organisational Capacity to Prepare Plan-Framework Materials:**

FOI 4029-03 (released January 2023) contains Advisory Committee on Vaccines Meeting 25 minutes (29 September 2021) documenting that TGA presented Strategy 2.3 methodology materials organised by Plan objectives to the advisory committee, including:

- Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR) analysis methodology specification
- Maximised Sequential Probability Ratio Test (MaxSPRT) approach description
- Australian Immunisation Register (AIR) denominator-based framework discussion
- Statistical methods documentation
- Strategy 2.3 framework presentation to advisory body

This documentary evidence demonstrates TGA possessed organisational capacity to prepare materials organised by Plan objectives for advisory body presentation. However, concurrent public safety reports (September 2021 onwards) contained:
- Zero Strategy 2.3 references
- Zero PRR methodology outputs
- Zero MaxSPRT approach documentation
- Zero AIR-denominator analysis evidence
- Zero acknowledgement of Plan framework

**The Documentation Gap:**

TGA demonstrated to Advisory Committee on Vaccines (September 2021) organisational capacity to:
- Prepare materials organised by Plan Strategy 2.3 framework
- Present methodology documentation to advisory bodies
- Discuss implementation approaches in governance forums

Yet concurrent public safety reports provided:
- Zero Strategy 2.3 framework references
- Zero methodology outputs
- Zero evidence of Plan-organised reporting

**Comparative Context:** Government performance reports routinely track activities against published strategies. The absence of any such tracking during Australia's largest medical intervention—whilst simultaneously presenting Plan-organised materials to advisory bodies—represents an accountability gap between internal advisory body transparency and public reporting.

**Impact on Vaccine Injury Compensation:**

The absence of accessible signal investigation documentation affects compensation claimants who must prove causation "on balance of probabilities." TGA investigated 148 signals, yet refuses to provide documentation to citizens. Of approximately 10,000 claims lodged under the COVID-19 Vaccine Claims Scheme, only 522 (5-10%) have been approved. The 9,500 rejected claimants cannot access signal validation data, risk quantification analyses, or statistical evidence that could support their causation arguments.

FOI 4029-03 demonstrates TGA prepared methodology materials for Advisory Committee discussion—but citizens seeking comparable information through Freedom of Information requests receive refusals stating documents "do not exist in consolidated form" or retrieval would require "unreasonable diversion of resources."

**Detailed compensation analysis:** [Compensation Analysis](../compensation-analysis/)

**Implication:** FOI 4029-03 demonstrates TGA possessed organisational capacity to prepare Plan-organised materials for advisory body presentation. The systematic absence of this material from concurrent public reports prevents verification that the Plan functioned as operational accountability framework accessible to citizens.

### Finding 5: Inadequate OAIC Search Scope Excluded Advisory Body Evidence

**ANAO Principle Applied:** "Agencies should maintain consistent standards for information access and transparency."

**TGA's September 2024 OAIC Search (MR22/00538):**

TGA claimed "all reasonable steps" were taken through searching 531 TRIM containers across pharmacovigilance and policy teams. However, this search methodology excluded:
- Advisory Committee on Vaccines (ACV) containers
- Advisory body meeting minutes systematically
- Container D21-3141615 (which holds FOI 4029-03)

**Why FOI 4029-03 Was Not Identified:**

The search focused on operational pharmacovigilance and policy team containers but did not systematically search advisory body containers where Cabinet-endorsed policy implementation would reasonably be expected to be discussed and monitored. Additionally, search terminology ("Safety Monitoring Plan") did not account for variations used in advisory contexts ("pharmacovigilance plan").

**Inadequate Search Scope for Policy Implementation Verification:**

Cabinet-endorsed policies are typically:
- Discussed in advisory committee forums
- Monitored through governance bodies
- Evaluated in strategic oversight contexts
- Documented in meeting minutes and presentations

TGA's search methodology excluded these governance-level document sources, creating a predictable blind spot for policy implementation evidence.

**Evidence Supporting Inadequate Scope Finding:**

**September 2021 - FOI 4029-03 (Advisory Committee on Vaccines):**

TGA presented Strategy 2.3 methodology materials organised by Plan objectives to advisory committee, demonstrating organisational capacity to:
- Prepare Plan-framework documentation
- Organise by Plan objectives for advisory body presentation
- Discuss implementation in governance forums

**September 2024 - OAIC Submission Search:**

TGA's search excluded Advisory Committee containers where this evidence exists, despite Cabinet-endorsed policy implementation reasonably being expected in advisory body discussions.

**June 2025 - FOI 25-0166 (Current OAIC Review MR25/01153):**

Applicant sought objective-specific Safety Plan implementation documentation comparable to materials in FOI 4029-03. TGA refused under section 24AA practical refusal provisions, claiming organisation by Plan objectives would require "unreasonable diversion of resources."

**The Contradiction:**

FOI 4029-03 proves TGA prepared materials organised by Plan objectives (September 2021), yet:
- September 2024 OAIC search excluded containers where this evidence exists
- June 2025 practical refusal claims organising by objectives is "impractical"

**Assessment Against "All Reasonable Steps" Standard:**

The OAIC "all reasonable steps" standard requires search methodology that is:
1. **Appropriately scoped** - covering all likely document locations
2. **Adequately termed** - using varied terminology
3. **Sufficiently broad** - not arbitrarily limited to operational teams
4. **Context-aware** - understanding how policies are discussed and monitored

TGA's search methodology failed to meet standards 1 and 3:
- **Scope:** Excluded advisory body containers where governance occurs
- **Breadth:** Limited to operational teams, excluded governance forums

**Third-Party Verification:** FOI 5275 (August 2024, independent applicant) sought monthly incidence data for conditions the Comirnaty AusPAR identified as requiring monitoring. TGA response: "the documents you have requested do not exist...the TGA does not hold 'incidence data' related to cancer." This provides independent corroboration of documentation gaps from a different applicant.

**Implication:** TGA's search methodology inadequacy prevented identification of FOI 4029-03, which demonstrates organisational capacity to prepare Plan-organised materials—directly relevant to assessing whether practical refusal based on claimed organisational impracticality is justified. An appropriately scoped search including advisory body containers would have identified this evidence, enabling proper assessment of TGA's practical refusal defence.

## Data Source Integration Summary

| **System** | **Volume** | **Type** | **Plan Link** | **Public Trail** | **Claimant Access** |
|------------|------------|----------|---------------|------------------|---------------------|
| **DAEN** | 140,000+ reports | Passive spontaneous | No Output 2.2 reconciliation documented | Database searchable but no signal investigation trails | Aggregate stats only, no causation data for 9,500 rejected claimants |
| **AusVaxSafety** | 3M+ responses, 62K medical visits | Active proactive | No Output 2.1 linkage documented | Aggregate summaries only, no methodology | No individual case access |
| **Safety Reports** | 150+ published (33 months) | Synthesis communication | Zero Plan references | No PRR/MaxSPRT outputs, no audit trails | Reassurance only, no signal validation |

---

## International Standards Compliance Assessment

### ICH E2E (Pharmacovigilance Planning)

**Requirement:** "Signal evaluation must be documented and traceable."

**Finding:** Reports provide summaries without systematic audit trails enabling verification. FOI 4029-03 demonstrates methodology documentation exists for advisory body presentation but outputs never published.

### WHO/EMA GVP Module IX (Signal Management)

**Requirement:** "Signal management processes should include documented disposition (validated/refuted/monitoring)."

**Finding:** 148 signals investigated, zero disposition matrix published.

### ANAO Better Practice (Performance Information)

**Requirement:** "Performance reporting should track outputs against published commitments."

**Finding:** Plan specified 20 outputs, zero tracking in 150+ reports.

### Comparative International Practice

- **United States (CDC):** Publishes detailed signal reports with causality assessments enabling external verification
- **United Kingdom (MHRA):** Weekly Yellow Card summaries with investigation details and methodology transparency
- **Australia (TGA):** Minimal investigation transparency, no systematic methodology outputs in public reports

---

## Audit Conclusion

This analysis demonstrates extensive surveillance activities occurred: 140,000+ DAEN reports collected, 3M+ AusVaxSafety responses gathered, 148 signals investigated, 57 regulatory actions taken, 150+ reports published across 33 months.

FOI 4029-03 provides evidence that TGA prepared Strategy 2.3 methodology materials and presented these to the Advisory Committee on Vaccines in September 2021, demonstrating organisational capacity to prepare materials organised by Plan objectives for advisory body forums. This capacity was again demonstrated in September 2024 when TGA organised 2,218 pages by Plan objectives for OAIC review (MR22/00538).

However, the systematic absence of Plan framework references in concurrent public reports, lack of documented data source reconciliation, unexplained methodology gaps in "expected rates" comparisons, observable surveillance degradation from enhanced to routine characteristics, and inadequate OAIC search scope that excluded advisory body containers collectively demonstrate a transparency gap between internal advisory body reporting and public accountability.

TGA's September 2024 search methodology excluded Advisory Committee containers where FOI 4029-03 exists—evidence of organisational capacity to prepare Plan-organised materials. This search scope inadequacy prevented identification of evidence directly relevant to assessing TGA's practical refusal defence claiming organisation by Plan objectives would be "impractical."

The systematic absence of Plan framework references across 150+ public reports, combined with evidence that Plan-organised materials were prepared for advisory bodies (FOI 4029-03) but excluded from concurrent public reporting and inaccessible through inadequately scoped FOI searches, demonstrates the Plan did not function as public accountability framework despite evidence of internal advisory body engagement.

**Standards Assessment:**
- **ISO 19011:** Audit evidence sufficient and appropriate
- **ANAO Principles:** Performance tracking against published strategy absent from public reports; advisory body received Plan-organised materials whilst public reports contained zero Plan references
- **ICH E2E:** Signal management documentation and traceability gaps identified
- **GVP IX:** Signal disposition matrix not publicly available despite 148 investigations documented

The question "Was the Plan implemented as operational accountability framework accessible to citizens?" cannot be resolved favourably. FOI 4029-03 demonstrates organisational capacity existed and materials were prepared for advisory body presentation, but systematic absence of this material from public reports and inadequate search methodology preventing identification through FOI processes demonstrates the Plan functioned as internal advisory body framework unavailable for public verification.
