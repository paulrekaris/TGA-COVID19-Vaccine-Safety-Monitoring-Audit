# Compensation Analysis: COVID-19 Vaccine Claims Scheme and TGA Documentation Gaps

## Executive Summary

Australia's COVID-19 Vaccine Claims Scheme approved 522 of 4,962 lodged claims (10.5% approval rate) before closure in September 2024. The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) investigated 148 COVID-19 vaccine safety signals and took 57 regulatory or information actions, but withholds associated investigation documentation. This creates evidentiary asymmetry: claimants must prove causation without access to the regulator's population-level signal data, despite 68.4 million doses administered under provisional approval to 21.2 million Australians.

## The Core Problem: Causation and Information Asymmetry

The scheme requires claimants to demonstrate, on the balance of probabilities, a causal link between vaccination and injury. This is the primary point of failure. While the TGA collects extensive surveillance data and conducts signal investigations to assess population-level risks, this evidence remains inaccessible to individuals, who are left relying on personal medical records and temporal association alone.

## Quantitative Evidence

### Claims Data

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Claims lodged | 4,962 (scheme closed Sep 2024) | ABC News (Sep 2024)¹ |
| Claims approved | 522 (10.5%) | ABC News (Sep 2024)¹ |
| Claims denied/withdrawn | ~4,440 (89.5%) | ABC News (Sep 2024)¹ |
| Total paid | >A$40 million | ABC News (Sep 2024)¹ |

COVERSE (COVID-19 Vaccine Injury Support and Research), in partnership with UNSW, documented 91% rejection/withdrawal rate in August 2024 research, citing barriers including narrow 'approved condition' lists and difficulty obtaining medical statements affirming causation.⁷

### TGA Surveillance Data

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| DAEN adverse event reports | Just over 137,000 (Dec 2022); now >140,000 | TGA Safety Report (22 Dec 2022)² |
| AusVaxSafety survey responses | 6.8 million+ | AusVaxSafety Data⁸ |
| Adverse events reported via AusVaxSafety | ~3 million | AusVaxSafety Data⁸,⁹ |
| Safety signals investigated | 148 | Senate Hansard (9 Oct 2025)³ |
| Regulatory/information actions taken | 57 | Senate Hansard (9 Oct 2025)³ |

**Context:** Against 68.4 million doses administered under provisional approval (21.2 million recipients) by July 2023.⁵

## Case Study Evidence

### Successful Claim (Workers' Compensation Pathway)
*Shepherd v State of South Australia* [2024] SAET 2. A youth worker with post-vaccine pericarditis succeeded via state workers' compensation following a tribunal ruling—a pathway unavailable to most citizens due to vaccine mandate context.¹⁰

### Deterred Applicant
Michelle Grace Hunder, diagnosed with vaccine-induced pericarditis, did not apply to the scheme due to its complexity, perceived low success rate, and restrictive eligibility criteria including overnight hospital admission requirements.¹¹

### Federal Scheme Success
An anonymous claimant with severe neurological injury waited three years from injury to settlement, noting the process was not the "quick administrative process" promised.⁷

### Systemic Rejection Pattern
COVERSE/UNSW research (August 2024) documents 91% rejection/withdrawal rate, identifying systemic barriers including narrow 'approved condition' lists and difficulty obtaining medical statements affirming causation.⁷

## The Documented Transparency Failure

### TGA's Acknowledged Documentation
In Senate testimony (9 October 2025), TGA representatives confirmed the agency investigated 148 safety signals and took 57 regulatory or information actions, implying documented investigation processes exist.³

### FOI Refusals to Citizens
The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) Decision [2025] AICmr 54 documents the Department of Health's position that Safety Plan implementation records "do not exist" in a "single consolidated form" and that producing relevant documents would involve a "vast volume" making provision impractical.⁶

### The Contradiction
The TGA confirms investigating 148 signals and taking 57 documented actions whilst simultaneously claiming signal investigation documentation cannot be consolidated or provided to citizens seeking to prove causation for compensation claims.

## Comparative International Transparency

- **United States:** Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) publishes regular Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) summaries and Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) analyses with detailed signal detection methodologies and assessment outcomes.¹²

- **United Kingdom:** Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) publishes detailed weekly Yellow Card reports with signal assessments and causality determinations.¹³

- **Australia:** TGA publishes aggregate statistics and safety advisories but does not publish systematic, detailed causality assessments from its 148 investigated signals and 57 regulatory actions.²,¹⁴

## Analysis and Implications

The scheme's design creates a structural barrier: claimants need access to population-level signal investigation data to meet the causation burden, but the agency holding that data refuses its release, citing non-consolidation or impracticality. This information asymmetry likely contributes significantly to the 89.5% rejection rate.

Internationally recognised pharmacovigilance principles emphasise transparent signal assessment and communication. The Australian approach creates an accountability gap between promised safety monitoring, documented signal detection (148 signals, 57 actions), and actionable public access to investigation findings.

## The Catch-22 Logic Chain
```
1. Government creates provisional approval pathway for rapid vaccine deployment
                                   ↓
2. Cabinet policy requires "enhanced safety monitoring" as evaluation mechanism
                                   ↓
3. TGA establishes Safety Plan promising systematic signal detection
                                   ↓
4. Government establishes compensation scheme acknowledging injuries may occur
                                   ↓
5. TGA collects 137,000+ DAEN reports + 3M AusVaxSafety adverse events
                                   ↓
6. TGA investigates 148 signals, takes 57 regulatory actions, documents findings
                                   ↓
7. Individual files compensation claim, needs to prove causation
                                   ↓
8. Individual requests TGA signal data to support causation argument
                                   ↓
9. TGA refuses access: "doesn't exist in consolidated form" or "impractical"
                                   ↓
10. Claim rejected: insufficient proof of causation
                                   ↓
Result: 89.5% rejection rate whilst signal investigation evidence remains inaccessible
```

## The Contradiction Matrix

| TGA Statement | Audience | Implication |
|---------------|----------|-------------|
| 148 signals investigated, 57 actions taken | Senate (Oct 2025)³ | Signal investigation documentation exists |
| Documents "don't exist in single consolidated form" | OAIC (2025)⁶ | Cannot provide to citizens |
| "Vast volume" makes production impractical | FOI claimants (2022-2025)⁶ | Too difficult to organise for citizen access |
| Successfully organised 2,218+ pages by Safety Plan objectives | OAIC review (Sept 2024)⁶ | Demonstrates capacity when legally required |

**Conclusion:** TGA demonstrates capacity to organise signal and safety monitoring documentation when facing Information Commissioner review, but claims impossibility when facing citizen FOI requests or compensation claimants seeking causation evidence.

## Proposed Evidence-Based Reforms

1. **Systematic Publication:** TGA should publish detailed summaries of all 148 investigated safety signals, including investigation methodologies, causality assessments, and subpopulation risk analyses.

2. **Dedicated Claimant Access Pathway:** Establish a streamlined, timely Freedom of Information (FOI) process for compensation claimants to access de-identified signal investigation data pertinent to their injury type.

3. **Reverse Evidentiary Burden for Established Signals:** For injuries matching the epidemiological pattern of a TGA-confirmed safety signal (e.g., myocarditis post-mRNA vaccine in young males), the scheme should bear the burden of disproving causation rather than requiring claimants to prove it.

## Limitation

This analysis cannot determine whether signal investigation documentation would actually support individual causation claims if released. It identifies only that the unavailability of this documentation creates a structural barrier to fair assessment of compensation claims, particularly where injury patterns align with detected signals.

## Conclusion

Approximately 4,440 claimants were denied compensation or withdrew their claims under the COVID-19 Vaccine Claims Scheme before its closure in September 2024. Their ability to substantiate claims was fundamentally hindered by inability to access TGA's safety signal investigation documentation covering 148 investigated signals and 57 regulatory actions. Resolving this information asymmetry is essential for procedural fairness and aligning compensation processes with the scheme's stated purpose of providing support for vaccine-related injuries.
