# TGA COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Monitoring Plan - Implementation Audit

## Executive Overview

Between February 2021 and July 2023, approximately 68 million COVID-19 vaccine doses (94% of the total rollout) were administered under provisional approval in Australia. Provisional approval under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 requires enhanced post-market monitoring as a legal safeguard when traditional evidence requirements cannot be met due to public health urgency.

The Therapeutic Goods Administration published a comprehensive COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Monitoring Plan in February 2021, outlining 20 specific outputs across 17 numbered strategies to ensure rigorous pharmacovigilance during this unprecedented vaccination programme.

This independent audit provides the first systematic assessment of whether TGA implemented its published plan. After four years of Freedom of Information requests and systematic evidence review, the findings reveal significant documentation gaps that prevent verification of enhanced monitoring implementation and compliance with provisional approval requirements.

**The Central Problem:** TGA cannot demonstrate through documentation that it systematically implemented the enhanced monitoring framework it promised, raising fundamental questions about regulatory accountability during Australia's largest medical intervention in history.

## The Investigation: Four Years of FOI Requests

This audit emerged from a four-year investigation using Freedom of Information requests to document TGA's implementation of its safety monitoring commitments. The investigation revealed a troubling pattern:

### Timeline of Contradictions

**February 2022**  
TGA claims requested implementation documents "don't exist"

**March 2022**  
TGA acknowledges "ample documentation" exists after all

**2022-2023**  
TGA organises extensive documentation for Information Commissioner review

**September 2024**  
TGA demonstrates capability to classify and organise 2,218+ pages of vaccine safety monitoring documentation by Safety Plan objectives for Information Commissioner (OAIC reference MR22/00538)

**June 2025**  
TGA identifies 399 Plan-aligned documents across 12 document categories but refuses to process them for citizen access, claiming classification requires "subjective interpretation" despite having successfully classified 2,218+ pages nine months earlier (FOI 25-0166)

**9 October 2025**  
TGA officials testify to Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee:
- Plan implementation was never systematically tracked
- Monitoring characterised as "day-to-day processes" not enhanced framework
- Producing documents by plan objectives would involve "some difficulty"
- Confirmed 148 safety signals investigated and 57 regulatory actions taken
- No documentation links specific signals to specific actions

### The Critical Question

If TGA can organise 2,218+ pages by plan objectives for Information Commissioner review, why can't it provide the same documentation to citizens after four years of requests? Every explanation points to regulatory failure:

1. Enhanced monitoring wasn't conducted as a structured programme with required documentation
2. Records are too disorganised to retrieve despite demonstrated capability
3. Documents were never systematically maintained as required by international standards
4. Verification of provisional approval conditions wasn't documented before transitions to full registration

---

## What This Audit Found

### Implementation Status by the Numbers

This assessment systematically evaluated all 20 plan outputs against publicly available evidence using ISO 19011:2018 audit principles and ANAO better practice guidance.

**Overall Implementation:**
- **15% Fully Implemented** (3/20 outputs) - Limited to public communication activities
- **55% Partially Implemented/Undocumented** (11/20 outputs) - Activities occurred but systematic framework implementation unverified  
- **30% Not Documented** (6/20 outputs) - Zero evidence in public record or FOI responses

### Four Critical Documentation Gaps

#### Gap 1: Signal Investigation Audit Trail

**What TGA Reported:**  
148 safety signals investigated, 57 regulatory actions taken (Senate testimony, 9 October 2025)

**What's Missing:**  
No published documentation linking specific signals to specific actions, investigation protocols applied, decision-making criteria used, or explanation for disposition of 91 signals that didn't result in regulatory action.

**Why This Matters:**  
International pharmacovigilance standards adopted by TGA (ICH E2E) and recognised best practice (CIOMS) require traceable audit trails from signal detection through assessment to regulatory decision. Without these trails, the enhanced monitoring framework implementation cannot be verified.

#### Gap 2: Provisional Approval Verification

**What Was Required:**  
Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 requires verification that provisional approval conditions have been satisfied before transition to full registration. TGA guidance requires documented evidence that enhanced monitoring commitments were implemented.

**What Was Found:**  
Systematic searches conducted under Information Commissioner direction (OAIC MR22/00538, September 2024) examined 531+ TRIM document management containers using eight plan-aligned search terms. Result: zero documents demonstrating verification that enhanced monitoring requirements were satisfied before Comirnaty (July 2023) or Spikevax (April 2023) transitioned to full registration.

**Why This Matters:**  
Without documented verification, compliance with provisional approval conditions for 68 million doses administered under provisional approval cannot be confirmed. The Australian Public Assessment Reports (AusPARs) documenting these transitions contain no evaluation against the Safety Monitoring Plan or verification that provisional approval conditions were met.

#### Gap 3: Enhanced Monitoring Framework Integration

**What Operated:**  
- AusVaxSafety conducted 6.8 million safety surveys
- TGA investigated 148 safety signals  
- TGA took 57 regulatory actions
- 150+ weekly safety reports published

**What's Missing:**  
Documentation showing systematic integration of these activities into an enhanced monitoring framework aligned with plan objectives. Zero documented coordination protocols linking AusVaxSafety's surveys to TGA's signal investigations. TGA officials characterised this work as "day-to-day processes" rather than enhanced monitoring tracked against plan objectives.

**Why This Matters:**  
Provisional approval requires enhanced monitoring distinct from routine pharmacovigilance. If monitoring cannot be distinguished from "day-to-day processes," the legal safeguard justifying reduced evidentiary requirements at approval is undermined.

#### Gap 4: Governance and Performance Measurement

**What Was Promised:**  
February 2021 plan indicated review and evaluation. TGA correspondence (February 2022) committed to reviewing implementation and identifying lessons learned.

**What Was Found:**  
Zero documentation of oversight mechanisms, performance measurement systems, or implementation tracking. No implementation reviews conducted. TGA's 2023-24 Annual Report contains no reference to the plan despite 68 million doses administered during this period. Promised February 2022 review never materialised.

**Why This Matters:**  
Without governance mechanisms and performance measurement, there is no way to verify that enhanced monitoring objectives were achieved or that provisional approval conditions were satisfied.

---

## The ANAO Context

The Australian National Audit Office conducted a performance audit of Australia's COVID-19 vaccine rollout in 2022 (*COVID-19 Vaccines: Vaccine Development and Procurement, and Vaccine Rollout*, ANAO Report No. 3 2021-22). That audit examined:

- Rollout efficiency and coordination across government agencies
- Vaccine procurement and distribution logistics  
- TGA's role in expediting regulatory approval processes
- Communication and implementation challenges

**What ANAO Did Not Examine:**

- Whether TGA's specific pharmacovigilance commitments in the February 2021 Safety Monitoring Plan were implemented as designed
- Whether enhanced monitoring distinct from routine surveillance actually occurred
- Whether provisional approval conditions were verified before transitions to full registration
- Whether TGA maintained documentation meeting international pharmacovigilance standards (ICH E2E, CIOMS)

This citizen audit addresses that gap. To date, there has been no dedicated ANAO performance audit of TGA's COVID-19 vaccine pharmacovigilance system implementation or compliance with provisional approval conditions requiring enhanced post-market safety monitoring.

## Methodology and Evidence Base

### Assessment Framework

This audit applies systematic principles drawn from ISO 19011:2018 (Guidelines for auditing management systems) and Australian National Audit Office better practice guidance:

**Core Principles:**
- Evidence-based approach (findings supported by objective, verifiable evidence)
- Independence (evaluation against TGA's own published standards and commitments)
- Due professional care (systematic methodology and judgement)
- Fair presentation (accurate reporting of findings including limitations)

**Regulatory Frameworks Applied:**
- Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 (provisional approval requirements)
- TGA guidance on provisional approval pathways and Risk Management Plans
- Australian Regulatory Guidelines for Prescription Medicines (ARGPM)
- International pharmacovigilance standards: ICH E2E, CIOMS, EMA GVP Module I
- Commonwealth records management: PGPA Act 2013, Archives Act 1983

### Evidence Hierarchy

Each of 20 plan outputs evaluated using a strict four-tier evidence hierarchy:

**Level 1 (Highest):** Published reports, Australian Public Assessment Reports (AusPARs), peer-reviewed literature, official databases with independent verification

**Level 2:** Government websites, official media releases, committee minutes, annual reports

**Level 3:** FOI responses, parliamentary testimony, official correspondence

**Level 4 (Lowest):** Unsubstantiated claims without supporting documentation

**Rating Criteria:**

"Fully implemented" requires coherent end-to-end documentation showing required processes, integrations, governance arrangements and outputs were established and sustained over time. Partial completion of component activities without implementation trail is rated "partially implemented" not "fully implemented."

### Evidence Sources

All findings are verifiable through:

- **TGA's published February 2021 Safety Monitoring Plan:** https://www.tga.gov.au/sites/default/files/covid-19-vaccine-safety-monitoring-plan.pdf
- **TGA public databases:** Database of Adverse Event Notifications (DAEN), weekly safety reports, regulatory decisions
- **FOI responses:** FOI 3643 (2022), FOI 25-0166 (2025)
- **Information Commissioner:** TGA submissions and reviews (MR22/00538, MR25/01153)
- **Senate testimony:** Community Affairs Legislation Committee, 9 October 2025: https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Hansard/Hansard_Display?bid=committees/estimate/29000/&sid=0003
- **Australian Public Assessment Reports:** Comirnaty (https://www.tga.gov.au/sites/default/files/2023-08/auspar-comirnaty-230807.pdf), Spikevax transition media release
- **Parliamentary records and Hansard**

No classified or confidential information is used. All source material is either publicly available or obtained through lawful FOI processes, enabling independent verification of every finding.

### Enhanced Evidence Gathering for Version 1.5

This version strengthens the evidence base through:

- **Systematic FOI and OAIC analysis:** Detailed review of TGA decisions, correspondence, and contradictions
- **OAIC-directed TRIM searches:** Analysis of MR22/00538 results covering 531+ containers
- **Structured online sweep:** Targeted, reproducible web scraping of government and partner websites designed to identify Plan-specific implementation documents outside formal FOI record
- **AusVaxSafety case study:** Detailed analysis of 6.8 million survey outputs and absence of documented integration with TGA signal management
- **Legislative framework analysis:** Comprehensive review of Therapeutic Goods Act provisions and TGA guidance requirements for provisional approval verification

### Limitations and Falsifiability

**What This Audit Assesses:**  
Documented evidence only. This is a documentation audit, not a clinical or scientific assessment.

**What Absence of Documentation Means:**  
Absence of documentation does not prove activities did not occur. However, it prevents verification, raises accountability questions, and indicates potential non-compliance with international pharmacovigilance standards requiring systematic documentation.

**Why Documentation Gaps Are Significant:**

The statistical probability that comprehensive implementation documentation exists but could not be located is negligible given:

1. TGA demonstrated capability to organise 2,218+ pages by plan objectives (OAIC MR22/00538, September 2024)
2. Senate testimony confirming 148 signals investigated, 57 actions taken, yet acknowledging documentation not organised by plan objectives
3. Four years of targeted FOI requests (FOI 3643, FOI 25-0166)
4. Systematic review of all publicly available TGA databases, websites, annual reports, and AusPARs
5. TGA's identification of 399 Plan-aligned documents but refusal to process them

If comprehensive implementation documentation exists, TGA has had multiple opportunities and clear incentive to produce it.

**Falsifiability:**  
This methodology is falsifiable—any finding can be disproved through production of contradicting documentation. The audit welcomes correction of errors or production of evidence demonstrating implementation.

## Version 1.5: What's New

This version represents substantial enhancement of the evidence base and analytical framework:

### Major Additions

**Provisional Approval Verification Gap Analysis**  
Comprehensive new Section 4.3 analyzing legislative framework, TGA guidance requirements, systematic search results revealing zero verification documentation (OAIC MR22/00538), and Australian Public Assessment Report analysis showing absence of Plan implementation verification before transitions to full registration for 68 million doses.

**Stricter Evidence Hierarchy**  
Recalculated implementation ratings using stricter evidence standards applied at the strategy level. Reduced "fully implemented" findings from 5 to 3 outputs. "Fully implemented" now requires coherent end-to-end documentation; partial completion without implementation trail is rated "partially implemented."

**AusVaxSafety Case Study**  
Detailed analysis contrasting large-scale active surveillance outputs (6.8 million surveys, 62,000 medical-attention reports) with absence of documented coordination with TGA signal management processes, illustrating gap between operational capability and documented enhanced framework integration.

**ANAO Audit Integration**  
Integrated ANAO's 2022 COVID-19 vaccine rollout audit findings to situate pharmacovigilance within broader governance context whilst confirming that Plan implementation and safety monitoring conditions lay outside ANAO audit scope.

**Structured Counter-Arguments**  
Added detailed responses to likely objections including reliance on generic SOPs, existence of expert committees, prior FOI/OAIC decisions, and claims about routine pharmacovigilance, strengthening defensibility of findings.

**Enhanced Evidence Base**  
Strengthened methodology through systematic analysis of TGA FOI decisions, OAIC-directed searches, TRIM source-file sampling, and structured online sweep of government websites designed for reproducibility and bias reduction.

**Refined Recommendations**  
Re-ordered priority reform areas to foreground critical governance, records management, and audit requirements based on strengthened evidence.

## The Call for Investigation

This repository serves as evidence-based documentation for parliamentary oversight and formal independent inquiry. It provides:

- Permanent, open-access record enabling independent verification and peer review
- Methodological framework for evaluating pharmacovigilance system implementation using replicable, falsifiable methods  
- Foundation for Australian National Audit Office performance audit
- Call for reform of pharmacovigilance frameworks, provisional approval processes, and governance mechanisms

### Why This Matters

Australia administered 68 million COVID-19 vaccine doses under provisional approval—the nation's largest medical intervention in history. Provisional approval requires enhanced post-market monitoring as a legal safeguard when traditional evidence standards cannot be met.

After four years of systematic FOI requests, TGA cannot demonstrate through documentation that:

1. It systematically implemented the enhanced monitoring framework it published and promised
2. Enhanced monitoring was distinct from routine "day-to-day processes" as provisional approval requires
3. It maintained audit trails linking 148 investigated signals to 57 regulatory actions as international standards require
4. It verified that provisional approval conditions were satisfied before 68 million doses transitioned to full registration
5. It conducted the governance, oversight, and performance measurement its own plan indicated

**The problem is straightforward:** TGA made commitments to 26 million Australians. It cannot demonstrate those commitments were kept. This requires investigation.
