# TGA COVID‑19 Vaccine Safety Monitoring Plan – Implementation Audit
[](https://github.com/paulrekaris/TGA-COVID19-Vaccine-Safety-Monitoring-Audit/blob/main/README.md#tga-covid-19-vaccine-safety-monitoring-plan---implementation-audit)

## Executive Summary
[](https://github.com/paulrekaris/TGA-COVID19-Vaccine-Safety-Monitoring-Audit/blob/main/README.md#executive-summary)

Between February 2021 and July 2023, approximately 68 million COVID‑19 vaccine doses (94% of the total rollout) were administered under provisional approval in Australia. Provisional approval under the *Therapeutic Goods Act 1989* requires **enhanced post‑market monitoring** as a legal safeguard when usual evidentiary requirements cannot be met because of public‑health urgency.

In February 2021, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) published a COVID‑19 Vaccine Safety Monitoring Plan setting out 20 specific outputs across 17 numbered strategies to deliver this enhanced pharmacovigilance during an unprecedented vaccination programme.

This independent audit provides the first systematic assessment of whether TGA implemented that Plan in a way that can be **demonstrated through documentation**. After four years of Freedom of Information (FOI) requests and structured evidence review, the findings reveal major documentation gaps that prevent verification of enhanced‑monitoring implementation and of compliance with provisional‑approval requirements.

> **Central problem:** TGA cannot demonstrate, on the documentary record, that it systematically implemented the enhanced monitoring framework it promised, raising fundamental questions about regulatory accountability during Australia’s largest medical intervention in history.


## The Investigation: Four Years of FOI Requests
[](https://github.com/paulrekaris/TGA-COVID19-Vaccine-Safety-Monitoring-Audit/blob/main/README.md#the-investigation-four-years-of-foi-requests)

This audit emerged from a four‑year FOI‑based investigation into TGA’s implementation of its published safety‑monitoring commitments. The investigation revealed a troubling pattern of changing institutional positions.

### Timeline of Contradictions
[](https://github.com/paulrekaris/TGA-COVID19-Vaccine-Safety-Monitoring-Audit/blob/main/README.md#timeline-of-contradictions)

- **February 2022**  
  TGA claims requested implementation documents “do not exist” (FOI 3643).

- **February 2022**  
  TGA acknowledges that “ample documentation” exists elsewhere, but does not identify Plan‑specific implementation records.

- **2022–2023**  
  TGA organises extensive vaccine‑safety documentation for Information Commissioner review.

- **September 2024**  
  Under direction from the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC reference MR22/00538), TGA searches more than 531 TRIM containers, and demonstrates capability to classify and organise **2,218+ pages** of vaccine‑safety documentation by Safety Plan objectives.

- **June 2025**  
  TGA identifies **399 Plan‑aligned documents** across 12 document categories but refuses to process them for citizen access, claiming that classification by Plan objectives requires “subjective interpretation”, despite having successfully classified 2,218+ pages nine months earlier (FOI 25‑0166).

- **9 October 2025** – Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee  
  TGA officials testify that:
  - Plan implementation was **never systematically tracked** by Plan objectives.  
  - Monitoring was managed through “day‑to‑day processes”, not a distinct enhanced framework.  
  - Producing documents by Plan objectives would involve “some difficulty” and a “vast volume of documents”.  
  - 148 safety signals were investigated and 57 regulatory actions taken – yet **no documentation links specific signals to specific actions**.


## The Critical Question
[](https://github.com/paulrekaris/TGA-COVID19-Vaccine-Safety-Monitoring-Audit/blob/main/README.md#the-critical-question)

If TGA can organise 2,218+ pages by Plan objectives for the Information Commissioner, why can it not provide equivalent documentation to citizens after four years of requests?

Each plausible explanation points to a serious failure in implementation, documentation, or both:

- Enhanced monitoring was not conducted as a structured programme with the required documentation.  
- Records are insufficiently organised to retrieve, despite demonstrated classification capability.  
- Documents were never systematically maintained as required by international pharmacovigilance and public‑sector record‑keeping standards.  
- Verification of provisional‑approval conditions was not documented before transitions to full registration.


## What This Audit Found
[](https://github.com/paulrekaris/TGA-COVID19-Vaccine-Safety-Monitoring-Audit/blob/main/README.md#what-this-audit-found)

### Implementation Status by the Numbers
[](https://github.com/paulrekaris/TGA-COVID19-Vaccine-Safety-Monitoring-Audit/blob/main/README.md#implementation-status-by-the-numbers)

The assessment systematically evaluated all 20 Plan outputs against publicly available evidence, using ISO 19011:2018 audit principles and ANAO better‑practice guidance.

**Overall implementation**

- **15% Fully implemented (3/20 outputs)** – mainly public‑communication activities with clear documentation.  
- **55% Partially implemented / undocumented (11/20 outputs)** – activities appear to have occurred, but systematic implementation and governance cannot be verified.  
- **30% Not documented (6/20 outputs)** – no evidence identified in public material or FOI/OAIC processes.


## Four Critical Documentation Gaps
[](https://github.com/paulrekaris/TGA-COVID19-Vaccine-Safety-Monitoring-Audit/blob/main/README.md#four-critical-documentation-gaps)

### Gap 1: Signal Investigation Audit Trail
[](https://github.com/paulrekaris/TGA-COVID19-Vaccine-Safety-Monitoring-Audit/blob/main/README.md#gap-1-signal-investigation-audit-trail)

**What TGA reported**

- 148 safety signals investigated.  
- 57 regulatory or consumer‑information actions taken (Senate testimony, 9 October 2025).

**What is missing**

- No published documentation linking individual signals to specific actions.  
- No documented investigation protocols applied to each signal.  
- No decision‑making criteria explaining why 57 signals led to actions while 91 did not.  
- No signal‑by‑signal audit trails enabling independent scrutiny.

**Why this matters**

International pharmacovigilance standards adopted or referenced by TGA (ICH E2E, CIOMS) require **traceable audit trails** from signal detection through assessment to regulatory decision. Without these trails:

- The enhanced monitoring framework cannot be verified.  
- Compliance with provisional‑approval conditions cannot be demonstrated.  
- Regulatory decision‑making remains opaque despite significant public‑health implications.


### Gap 2: Provisional Approval Verification
[](https://github.com/paulrekaris/TGA-COVID19-Vaccine-Safety-Monitoring-Audit/blob/main/README.md#gap-2-provisional-approval-verification)

**What was required**

- The *Therapeutic Goods Act 1989* requires TGA to be satisfied that provisional‑approval conditions, including enhanced post‑market monitoring, have been met before extensions and transition to full registration.  
- TGA guidance requires documented evidence to support these verification decisions.

**What was found**

- OAIC‑directed TRIM searches (MR22/00538, September 2024) across **531+ containers** using eight Plan‑aligned search terms identified **zero** documents demonstrating verification that enhanced‑monitoring requirements were satisfied before Comirnaty (July 2023) or Spikevax (April 2023) transitioned to full registration.  
- Australian Public Assessment Reports (AusPARs) and TGA media releases covering these transitions contain **no evaluation against the Safety Monitoring Plan**, no checklists of provisional‑approval conditions, and no Plan‑level verification records.

**Why this matters**

Without documented verification:

- Compliance with provisional‑approval conditions for approximately 68 million doses cannot be confirmed.  
- The integrity of the provisional‑approval framework – which relies on enhanced, documented post‑market monitoring – is called into question.


### Gap 3: Enhanced Monitoring Framework Integration
[](https://github.com/paulrekaris/TGA-COVID19-Vaccine-Safety-Monitoring-Audit/blob/main/README.md#gap-3-enhanced-monitoring-framework-integration)

**What operated**

- AusVaxSafety conducted around **6.8 million** vaccine‑safety surveys.  
- TGA investigated **148** safety signals and took **57** regulatory actions.  
- More than **150** weekly COVID‑19 vaccine safety reports were published.

**What is missing**

- Documentation showing systematic integration of these activities into the enhanced monitoring framework defined in the Plan.  
- Coordination protocols or data‑flow documentation linking AusVaxSafety outputs to TGA signal investigations.  
- Evidence that enhanced processes were distinguished from routine “day‑to‑day” pharmacovigilance and tracked against Plan objectives.

**Why this matters**

Provisional approval requires **enhanced monitoring** distinct from business‑as‑usual surveillance. If monitoring cannot be distinguished, documented and verified as enhanced, the legal safeguard justifying reduced pre‑market evidence is undermined.


### Gap 4: Governance and Performance Measurement
[](https://github.com/paulrekaris/TGA-COVID19-Vaccine-Safety-Monitoring-Audit/blob/main/README.md#gap-4-governance-and-performance-measurement)

**What was promised**

- The February 2021 Plan referred to review, evaluation and governance.  
- TGA correspondence (February 2022) stated that implementation would be reviewed and lessons identified.

**What was found**

- No documentation of Plan‑level governance mechanisms, oversight structures or performance‑measurement systems.  
- No implementation reviews or evaluations located in public sources, FOI releases or OAIC‑directed searches.  
- TGA’s 2022‑23 and 2023‑24 annual/performance reports contain **no reference to the Plan**, despite 68 million provisionally approved doses being administered.

**Why this matters**

Without governance and performance‑measurement records:

- There is no way to verify that enhanced‑monitoring objectives were achieved.  
- Oversight bodies cannot assess whether provisional‑approval conditions were systematically monitored and enforced.

## ANAO audit history and the pharmacovigilance gap
[](https://github.com/paulrekaris/TGA-COVID19-Vaccine-Safety-Monitoring-Audit/blob/main/README.md#the-anao-context)

The Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) has examined TGA several times since the mid‑1990s, with reports focused on prescription‑medicine evaluation, the regulation of non‑prescription and complementary medicines, manufacturer compliance and cost‑recovery arrangements. These audits have primarily assessed pre‑market evaluation, regulatory processes, enforcement and financial frameworks, rather than whether specific pharmacovigilance plans were implemented as designed or whether enhanced post‑market commitments were demonstrably delivered.

In 2021–22, ANAO conducted a performance audit of the national COVID‑19 vaccine rollout (*COVID‑19 Vaccines: Vaccine Development and Procurement, and Vaccine Rollout*, Report No. 3 2021‑22). That audit examined rollout efficiency and coordination, vaccine procurement and distribution logistics, TGA’s role in expediting regulatory approval, and high‑level communication and implementation challenges.

Crucially, that audit did **not** examine:

- Whether TGA’s specific pharmacovigilance commitments in the February 2021 COVID‑19 Vaccine Safety Monitoring Plan were implemented as designed.  
- Whether “enhanced” monitoring, distinct from routine surveillance, actually operated in practice.  
- Whether provisional‑approval conditions were verified and documented before vaccines transitioned to full registration.  
- Whether TGA’s records and decision trails met international pharmacovigilance standards (e.g. ICH E2E, CIOMS) for traceable audit trails from signal detection to regulatory action.

As a result, there is currently no independent assurance that the enhanced post‑market safety monitoring promised to Australians – and relied upon to justify provisional approval for 68 million doses – was ever implemented and documented to the standard expected of a national regulator.

This citizen audit is intended to help fill that oversight gap by providing:

- A structured, evidence‑based implementation assessment of the February 2021 Safety Monitoring Plan.  
- A clear mapping of documentation gaps around signal management, AusVaxSafety integration, provisional‑approval verification and governance.  
- A concrete evidentiary platform on which ANAO could scope and conduct a dedicated performance audit of TGA’s COVID‑19 vaccine pharmacovigilance system and its compliance with provisional‑approval conditions requiring enhanced post‑market safety monitoring.

Taken together, the scale of provisional use (68 million doses), the absence of a demonstrable implementation trail, and the lack of any prior ANAO examination of these specific pharmacovigilance issues provide a strong public‑interest basis for ANAO to initiate a focused performance audit.

## Methodology and Evidence Base
[](https://github.com/paulrekaris/TGA-COVID19-Vaccine-Safety-Monitoring-Audit/blob/main/README.md#methodology-and-evidence-base)

### Assessment Framework
[](https://github.com/paulrekaris/TGA-COVID19-Vaccine-Safety-Monitoring-Audit/blob/main/README.md#assessment-framework)

This audit applies systematic principles drawn from:

- **ISO 19011:2018 – Guidelines for auditing management systems**  
  - Evidence‑based approach.  
  - Independence and due professional care.  
  - Fair presentation of findings and limitations.

- **ANAO better‑practice guidance**  
  - Assessment against published plans and criteria.  
  - Triangulation across multiple sources.  
  - Emphasis on accountability and transparency.

**Regulatory frameworks applied**

- *Therapeutic Goods Act 1989* (provisional‑approval requirements).  
- TGA guidance on provisional approval pathways and Risk Management Plans.  
- Australian Regulatory Guidelines for Prescription Medicines (ARGPM).  
- International pharmacovigilance standards: ICH E2E, CIOMS, EMA GVP Module I.  
- Commonwealth records‑management and performance‑reporting frameworks: PGPA Act 2013, Archives Act 1983.

### Evidence Hierarchy
[](https://github.com/paulrekaris/TGA-COVID19-Vaccine-Safety-Monitoring-Audit/blob/main/README.md#evidence-hierarchy)

Each of the 20 Plan outputs was evaluated using a four‑tier hierarchy:

- **Level 1 (highest):** Published reports, AusPARs, peer‑reviewed literature, official databases with independent verification.  
- **Level 2:** Government websites, official media releases, committee minutes, annual/performance reports.  
- **Level 3:** FOI decisions and schedules, OAIC submissions and decisions, Senate testimony, official correspondence.  
- **Level 4 (lowest):** Unsubstantiated claims without supporting documentation.

**Rating criteria**

- “**Fully implemented**” requires coherent end‑to‑end documentation showing that required processes, integrations, governance arrangements and outputs were in place and sustained over time.  
- Partial completion of activities without an implementation trail is rated “**partially implemented**”, not “fully implemented”.

### Evidence Sources

## Enhanced Evidence Gathering for Version 1.5
[](https://github.com/paulrekaris/TGA-COVID19-Vaccine-Safety-Monitoring-Audit/blob/main/README.md#enhanced-evidence-gathering-for-version-15)

Version 1.5 strengthens the evidence base through:

- **Systematic FOI and OAIC analysis** – detailed review of TGA decisions, correspondence and contradictions.  
- **OAIC‑directed TRIM searches** – analysis of MR22/00538 results covering 531+ containers.  
- **Structured online sweep** – reproducible searches of government and partner websites for Plan‑specific implementation documents outside FOI.  
- **AusVaxSafety case study** – analysis of 6.8 million survey outputs and the absence of documented integration with TGA signal management.  
- **Legislative framework analysis** – review of *Therapeutic Goods Act* provisions and TGA guidance on provisional‑approval verification.

## Limitations and Falsifiability
[](https://github.com/paulrekaris/TGA-COVID19-Vaccine-Safety-Monitoring-Audit/blob/main/README.md#limitations-and-falsifiability)

**Scope**

This audit assesses **documented evidence only**. It does **not** evaluate clinical safety or efficacy of COVID‑19 vaccines, nor the appropriateness of individual regulatory decisions. Findings concern documentation, records management and governance processes.

**Meaning of documentation gaps**

Absence of documentation does not prove that activities never occurred. It does, however:

- Prevent independent verification of TGA’s assurances about “enhanced” monitoring.  
- Raise questions about transparency, accountability and compliance with international pharmacovigilance standards requiring systematic documentation.  
- Indicate potential non‑compliance with Commonwealth record‑keeping and performance‑reporting obligations.

**Why the gaps are significant**

The probability that comprehensive implementation documentation exists but could not be located is low, given:

1. TGA has demonstrated the ability to classify 2,218+ pages of Plan‑aligned material for OAIC (MR22/00538, September 2024).  
2. Senate testimony confirmed that Plan implementation was never systematically tracked and that monitoring was treated as “day‑to‑day processes”.  
3. Multiple FOI requests over four years (FOI 3643, FOI 25‑0166) targeted the same implementation evidence.  
4. Systematic review of publicly available TGA databases, websites, annual reports and AusPARs found no Plan‑level implementation or verification trail.

**Falsifiability**

The methodology is explicitly falsifiable: any finding can be disproved by production of contradicting documentation. Corrections and additional evidence are welcomed, and would be incorporated into future versions with transparent version history.

- **Structured counter‑arguments** – explicit responses to common objections (e.g. reliance on generic SOPs, expert committees, FOI decisions).  
- **Refined recommendations** – reordered and strengthened reform priorities (governance, records management, independent audit).


## Oversight and Accountability
[](https://github.com/paulrekaris/TGA-COVID19-Vaccine-Safety-Monitoring-Audit/blob/main/README.md#oversight-and-accountability)

This assessment has been provided to multiple oversight bodies:

- **Australian National Audit Office (ANAO)** – submitted 27 November 2024, requesting a dedicated performance audit of TGA’s COVID‑19 vaccine pharmacovigilance implementation and compliance with provisional‑approval conditions.  
- **Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee** – provided to members to inform questioning and oversight; key findings were confirmed in principle through testimony on 9 October 2025.  
- **Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC)** – central to reviews MR22/00538 and MR25/01153, and the 2025 AICmr 54 decision.  
- **Commonwealth Ombudsman** – complaint submitted 1 April 2025 (ref: 2025‑806374) regarding contradictions in TGA responses and systemic issues in pharmacovigilance governance and FOI administration.

## The Call for Investigation
[](https://github.com/paulrekaris/TGA-COVID19-Vaccine-Safety-Monitoring-Audit/blob/main/README.md#the-call-for-investigation)

Australia administered 68 million COVID‑19 vaccine doses under provisional approval – the country’s largest deployment of provisionally approved medicines. Provisional approval was justified on the basis that **enhanced, documented post‑market monitoring** would compensate for limited pre‑market data.

After four years of systematic FOI requests and documentary review, TGA has not demonstrated that:

- It systematically implemented the enhanced monitoring framework described in the February 2021 Plan.  
- Enhanced monitoring was distinct from routine “day‑to‑day processes”, as provisional approval requires.  
- It maintained audit trails linking 148 investigated signals to 57 regulatory actions, as international standards envisage.  
- It verified, and documented verification of, provisional‑approval conditions before 68 million doses transitioned to full registration.  
- It established the governance, oversight and performance‑measurement arrangements its own Plan indicated.

The problem is straightforward: **TGA made commitments to 26 million Australians about enhanced, documented safety monitoring. It cannot, on the record, show that those commitments were kept.** This gap in demonstrable accountability requires formal, independent investigation and reform of pharmacovigilance and provisional‑approval frameworks.
