# TGA COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Monitoring Plan - Implementation Audit

## Introduction

Between February 2021 and November 2023, Australia administered approximately 63.8 million COVID-19 vaccine doses under provisional approval requiring enhanced safety monitoring. The Therapeutic Goods Administration published a comprehensive COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Monitoring Plan in February 2021, outlining 24 specific outputs and activities to ensure rigorous pharmacovigilance during this unprecedented vaccination programme.

Compliance with the published plan was particularly critical given provisional approval requirements under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989. Three COVID-19 vaccines received provisional approval during this period: Pfizer/BioNTech Comirnaty (January 2021), AstraZeneca Vaxzevria (February 2021), and Moderna Spikevax (August 2021). Provisional approval is granted when traditional evidence requirements cannot be met but there is a clear public health need, with enhanced post-market monitoring serving as a key safeguard. The Safety Monitoring Plan represented TGA's documented commitment to enhanced pharmacovigilance as a condition of provisional approval for these vaccines.

After four years of Freedom of Information requests seeking documentation of the plan's implementation, systematic contradictions emerged in TGA's responses—ranging from claims that requested documents "don't exist" to acknowledgment of "ample documentation," followed by refusal of access on grounds of subjective classification difficulty, despite TGA's demonstrated capability to organise 2,218+ pages by plan objectives for Information Commissioner review.

This repository provides a comprehensive, independent implementation audit using ISO 19011:2018 audit principles and Australian National Audit Office better practice guidance, creating a permanent, open-access record to enable independent verification, peer review, parliamentary oversight, and formal independent inquiry.

## Key Findings

The assessment examines publicly available evidence for 24 specific outputs and activities mandated in TGA's plan over four years (February 2021 - February 2025).

**Implementation Status:**
- **21% Fully Documented** (5/24 outputs)
- **54% Partial/Undocumented** (13/24 outputs)  
- **25% No Evidence** (6/24 outputs)

**Critical Gaps Identified:**
- Active surveillance system enhancements: No public documentation
- Weekly causality assessments: No evidence of systematic process
- International collaboration outputs: Minimal documentation
- Public transparency commitments: Substantially unfulfilled

**Key Accountability Concerns:**

TGA demonstrated capability to classify and organise 2,218+ pages of vaccine safety monitoring documentation for Information Commissioner review (September 2024), while simultaneously claiming identical classification tasks were "too subjective" for citizen FOI access. TGA officials testified to Senate Estimates (October 2024) that the plan's key themes "essentially describe our day-to-day processes" rather than separately tracked objectives, with acknowledgment that producing such documents would involve "some difficulty" and a "vast volume of documents."

**Temporal Pattern:**
- Feb 2022: TGA claims requested documents "don't exist"
- Mar 2022: TGA acknowledges "ample documentation" exists  
- 2022-2023: TGA organises extensive documentation for IC review
- Oct 2024: TGA confirms to Senate implementation was "never systematically tracked"
- 2024-2025: TGA refuses citizen access citing subjective classification

## Methodology

This assessment applies systematic audit principles drawn from ISO 19011:2018 (Guidelines for auditing management systems) and Australian National Audit Office better practice guidance. The approach emphasises evidence-based analysis, systematic documentation review, and objective evaluation against stated commitments.

**Audit Principles Applied:**

ISO 19011 principles include: integrity (reliance on verifiable evidence), fair presentation (accurate reporting of findings), due professional care (systematic methodology), independence (evaluation against TGA's own standards), and evidence-based approach (findings supported by documented sources). ANAO principles include assessment against published plans, verification through multiple evidence sources, and focus on accountability and transparency in public administration.

**Regulatory Frameworks:**

The audit methodology mapped TGA's 24 plan outputs against TGA's Australian Regulatory Guidelines for Prescription Medicines (ARGPM), international pharmacovigilance standards (ICH E2E, EMA GVP Module I), and Commonwealth records management requirements (PGPA Act 2013, Archives Act 1983). Provisional approval processes were benchmarked against comparable frameworks from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA).

**Evidence Hierarchy:**
- **Level 1** (Highest): Published reports, peer-reviewed literature, official databases
- **Level 2**: Government websites, media releases, committee minutes  
- **Level 3**: FOI responses, parliamentary answers
- **Level 4** (Lowest): TGA claims without supporting documentation

**Assessment Criteria:**

Each of 24 plan outputs evaluated against publicly available evidence using systematic documentation review, FOI requests (2021-2025), and verification against TGA's own statements to oversight bodies. The methodology is falsifiable—any finding can be disproved through production of contradicting documentation by TGA. All source material is publicly available or obtained through lawful FOI processes, enabling independent replication of findings.

## Context and Oversight Engagement

This audit was conducted following four years of Freedom of Information (FOI) requests seeking documentation of TGA's implementation of its published safety monitoring plan. The assessment has been:

- **Submitted to**: Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) on 27 November 2024, requesting performance audit
- **Provided to**: Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee and Members of Parliament for oversight purposes
- **Reviewed by**: Information Commissioner (multiple matters: MR22/00538, MR25/01153)
- **Documented in**: Commonwealth Ombudsman complaint (ref: 2025-806374) regarding response contradictions

**ANAO Audit History and the Pharmacovigilance Gap:**

The Australian National Audit Office has examined the TGA several times since the mid-1990s, focusing on prescription drug evaluation, regulation of non-prescription and complementary medicines, manufacturer compliance, and cost-recovery principles. These audits primarily assessed pre-market evaluation, regulatory processes, enforcement, and financial frameworks, rather than whether specific pharmacovigilance plans were implemented as designed. 

To date there has been no dedicated ANAO performance audit of TGA's COVID-19 vaccine pharmacovigilance system or of its compliance with provisional approval conditions requiring "enhanced" post-market safety monitoring. This report is intended to help fill that gap by providing an independent implementation audit and evidence supporting a formal ANAO performance audit.

## Verification and Limitations

**All findings are verifiable through:**
- TGA's published February 2021 Safety Monitoring Plan: https://www.tga.gov.au/sites/default/files/covid-19-vaccine-safety-monitoring-plan.pdf
- TGA public websites and databases (accessed 2021-2025)
- FOI request responses (FOI 3094, 3095, 3176, 3869, 4698)
- TGA submissions to Information Commissioner (MR22/00538 - September 2024)
- Information Commissioner decisions and reviews
- Senate Estimates testimony (9 October 2024): https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Hansard/Hansard_Display?bid=committees/estimate/29000/&sid=0003
- Parliamentary committee records and Hansard
- Published peer-reviewed literature

No classified or confidential information is included. All source material either publicly available or obtained through lawful FOI processes.

**Limitations:**

This audit assesses documented evidence only. Absence of documentation does not prove activities did not occur, but raises questions about public transparency and accountability, verification of safety monitoring claims, alignment between promised and delivered outputs, and accessibility of evidence for independent review.

However, the statistical probability that relevant documentation exists but could not be located is negligible given: 

1. **TGA's demonstrated capability** to organise and classify 2,218+ pages of vaccine safety monitoring documentation by Safety Plan objectives for Information Commissioner review (September 2024)
2. **TGA officials' testimony** to Senate Estimates that the plan's key themes "essentially describe our day-to-day processes" rather than separately tracked objectives, with acknowledgment that producing such documents would involve "some difficulty" and a "vast volume of documents" (October 2024)
3. **Multiple FOI requests** over four years targeting the same documentation (FOI 3094, 3095, 3176, 3869, 4698)
4. **Systematic review** of all publicly available TGA databases, websites, and published materials

If documentation implementing the Safety Plan exists, TGA has had multiple opportunities and clear incentive to produce it.

## Disclaimer and Declaration

This assessment evaluates publicly available evidence for implementation of stated commitments in TGA's published COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Monitoring Plan. It does not assess the clinical safety or efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, nor the appropriateness of individual regulatory decisions. The findings relate to documentation, records management, and governance processes—not clinical or scientific judgements. The assessment is based exclusively on TGA's own documents and statements.

Full research methodology, limitations, key assumptions, and assessment criteria are outlined in the detailed audit report available in this repository.

**This work has not been peer-reviewed or independently verified.** It is made publicly available to encourage independent verification, peer review, and scrutiny by other researchers, citizens, oversight bodies, and interested parties. The author welcomes correction of any errors or production of contradicting evidence.

This analysis is based on extensive review of available documentation and is accurate to the best of my knowledge. Given the substantial volume of materials examined, inadvertent errors in citation or interpretation may occur. Corrections are welcomed.

I declare that the information in this assessment is accurate to the best of my knowledge. All factual claims are supported by documented evidence with source citations. This work is conducted in good faith in the public interest.

**The problem documented is simple: after four years, the TGA cannot demonstrate that promises made to 26 million Australians were kept. This requires investigation.**
