## Purpose

This repository documents an independent audit of the TGA's COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Monitoring Plan (February 2021), assessing evidence for 20 specified enhanced-pharmacovigilance outputs over four years (2021-2025).

During Australia's largest medical intervention in history, approximately 68 million COVID-19 vaccine doses were administered under provisional approval. 
This analysis addresses a single question: whether the implementation of the COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Monitoring Plan can now be independently verified 
through records, as required for an enhanced monitoring framework relied upon for provisional approval.

**Intended for:** Parliamentary oversight, administrative review, accountability assessment, academic research, media investigation, and historical record.

**Methodology:** Evidence-based analysis using publicly available material, lawful FOI processes, and audit principles from ISO 19011:2018, ANAO guidance, 
and international pharmacovigilance standards (ICH E2E, CIOMS).


## Executive Summary

On 13 November 2020, National Cabinet endorsed the Australian COVID‑19 Vaccination Policy, which committed the Commonwealth to post‑market safety monitoring of COVID‑19 vaccines by the TGA and flagged the need for dedicated pharmacovigilance arrangements for the rollout. In February 2021, the TGA’s COVID‑19 Vaccine Safety Monitoring Plan translated this policy setting into a national COVID‑19 Vaccine Pharmacovigilance Plan, specifying 20 outputs across 17 numbered strategies spanning AEFI collection, signal detection, data integration, regulatory action, communication and collaboration. AusVaxSafety, coordinated by NCIRS and funded by the Australian Government, subsequently described its large‑scale active surveillance program for COVID‑19 vaccines as operating as part of this national pharmacovigilance plan led by the TGA and the Australian Government, thereby positioning active surveillance as a core delivery mechanism within the TGA‑led safety‑monitoring framework.  

Between February 2021 and late June 2023, more than 68 million COVID‑19 vaccine doses were administered in Australia, with the vast majority given while the vaccines were only provisionally registered on the ARTG. Provisional approval under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 permits time‑limited registration on the basis of preliminary clinical data where usual pre‑market evidentiary requirements cannot be met in time for a public‑health emergency, and TGA’s provisional‑registration guidance states that such medicines are subject to enhanced post‑market surveillance, additional pharmacovigilance conditions and prioritisation within its monitoring and compliance framework.​

This independent audit provides the first systematic assessment of whether TGA implemented that Plan in a way that can be **demonstrated through documentation**. After four years of Freedom of Information (FOI) requests and structured evidence review, the findings reveal major documentation gaps that prevent verification of enhanced‑monitoring implementation and of compliance with provisional‑approval requirements.

> **Central problem:** TGA cannot demonstrate, on the documentary record, that it systematically implemented the Cabinet‑endorsed enhanced safety monitoring framework set out in the Australian COVID‑19 Vaccination Policy, raising fundamental questions about regulatory accountability during Australia’s largest medical intervention.


## The Investigation: Four Years of FOI Requests


This audit emerged from a four‑year FOI‑based investigation into TGA’s implementation of its published safety‑monitoring commitments. The investigation revealed a troubling pattern of changing institutional positions.

### Timeline of Contradictions


- **February 2022**  
  TGA claims requested implementation documents “do not exist” (FOI 3643).

- **February 2022**  
  TGA acknowledges that “ample documentation” exists elsewhere, but does not identify Plan‑specific implementation records.

- **2022–2023**  
  TGA organises extensive vaccine‑safety documentation for Information Commissioner review.

- **September 2024**  
  Under direction from the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC reference MR22/00538), TGA searches more than 531 TRIM containers, and demonstrates capability to classify and organise **2,218+ pages** of vaccine‑safety documentation by Safety Plan objectives.

- **June 2025**  
  TGA identifies **399 Plan‑aligned documents** across 12 document categories but refuses to process them for citizen access, claiming that classification by Plan objectives requires “subjective interpretation”, despite having successfully classified 2,218+ pages nine months earlier (FOI 25‑0166).

- **9 October 2025** – Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee  
  TGA officials testify that:
  - Plan implementation was **never systematically tracked** by Plan objectives.  
  - Monitoring was managed through “day‑to‑day processes”, not a distinct enhanced framework.  
  - Producing documents by Plan objectives would involve “some difficulty” and a “vast volume of documents”.  
  - 148 safety signals were investigated and 57 regulatory actions taken – yet **no documentation links specific signals to specific actions**.


## The Critical Question


If TGA can organise 2,218+ pages by Plan objectives for the Information Commissioner, why can it not provide equivalent documentation to citizens after four years of requests?

Each plausible explanation points to a serious failure in implementation, documentation, or both:

- Enhanced monitoring was not conducted as a structured programme with the required documentation.  
- Records are insufficiently organised to retrieve, despite demonstrated classification capability.  
- Documents were never systematically maintained as required by international pharmacovigilance and public‑sector record‑keeping standards.  
- Verification of provisional‑approval conditions was not documented before transitions to full registration.


## What This Audit Found


### Implementation Status by the Numbers

The assessment systematically evaluated all 20 Plan outputs against publicly available evidence, using ISO 19011:2018 audit principles and ANAO better‑practice guidance.

**Overall implementation**

- **15% Fully implemented (3/20 outputs)** – mainly public‑communication activities with clear documentation.  
- **55% Partially implemented / undocumented (11/20 outputs)** – activities appear to have occurred, but systematic implementation and governance cannot be verified.  
- **30% Not documented (6/20 outputs)** – no evidence identified in public material or FOI/OAIC processes.


## Four Critical Documentation Gaps


### Gap 1: Signal Investigation Audit Trail


**What TGA reported**

- 148 safety signals investigated.  
- 57 regulatory or consumer‑information actions taken (Senate testimony, 9 October 2025).

**What is missing**

- No published documentation linking individual signals to specific actions.  
- No documented investigation protocols applied to each signal.  
- No decision‑making criteria explaining why 57 signals led to actions while 91 did not.  
- No signal‑by‑signal audit trails enabling independent scrutiny.

**Why this matters**

International pharmacovigilance standards adopted or referenced by TGA (ICH E2E, CIOMS) require **traceable audit trails** from signal detection through assessment to regulatory decision. Without these trails:

- The enhanced monitoring framework cannot be verified.  
- Compliance with provisional‑approval conditions cannot be demonstrated.  
- Regulatory decision‑making remains opaque despite significant public‑health implications.


### Gap 2: Provisional Approval Verification


**What was required**

- The *Therapeutic Goods Act 1989* requires TGA to be satisfied that provisional‑approval conditions, including enhanced post‑market monitoring, have been met before extensions and transition to full registration.  
- TGA guidance requires documented evidence to support these verification decisions.

**What was found**

- OAIC‑directed TRIM searches (MR22/00538, September 2024) across **531+ containers** using eight Plan‑aligned search terms identified **zero** documents demonstrating verification that enhanced‑monitoring requirements were satisfied before Comirnaty (July 2023) or Spikevax (April 2023) transitioned to full registration.  
- Australian Public Assessment Reports (AusPARs) and TGA media releases covering these transitions contain **no evaluation against the Safety Monitoring Plan**, no checklists of provisional‑approval conditions, and no Plan‑level verification records.

**Why this matters**

Without documented verification:

- Compliance with provisional‑approval conditions for approximately 68 million doses cannot be confirmed.  
- The integrity of the provisional‑approval framework – which relies on enhanced, documented post‑market monitoring – is called into question.


### Gap 3: Enhanced Monitoring Framework Integration


**What operated**

- AusVaxSafety conducted around **6.8 million** vaccine‑safety surveys.  
- TGA investigated **148** safety signals and took **57** regulatory actions.  
- More than **150** weekly COVID‑19 vaccine safety reports were published.

**What is missing**

- Documentation showing systematic integration of these activities into the enhanced monitoring framework defined in the Plan.  
- Coordination protocols or data‑flow documentation linking AusVaxSafety outputs to TGA signal investigations.  
- Evidence that enhanced processes were distinguished from routine “day‑to‑day” pharmacovigilance and tracked against Plan objectives.

**Why this matters**

Provisional approval requires **enhanced monitoring** distinct from business‑as‑usual surveillance. If monitoring cannot be distinguished, documented and verified as enhanced, the legal safeguard justifying reduced pre‑market evidence is undermined.


### Gap 4: Governance and Performance Measurement


**What was promised**

- The February 2021 Plan referred to review, evaluation and governance.  
- TGA correspondence (February 2022) stated that implementation would be reviewed and lessons identified.

**What was found**

- No documentation of Plan‑level governance mechanisms, oversight structures or performance‑measurement systems.  
- No implementation reviews or evaluations located in public sources, FOI releases or OAIC‑directed searches.  
- TGA’s 2022‑23 and 2023‑24 annual/performance reports contain **no reference to the Plan**, despite 68 million provisionally approved doses being administered.

**Why this matters**

Without governance and performance‑measurement records:

- There is no way to verify that enhanced‑monitoring objectives were achieved.  
- Oversight bodies cannot assess whether provisional‑approval conditions were systematically monitored and enforced.

### From "Molecule to Market" to Enhanced Safety Monitoring: The Teaching-Practice Gap

In October 2021, at the peak of provisional approval rollout, senior TGA officials taught Master of Pharmacy students at UTS about COVID-19 vaccine safety monitoring. *(See [TGA teaching materials](./reference-documents/#tga-pharmacovigilance-teaching-materials-october-2021-evidence-of-a-gap-between-promise-and-practice))*

What they showed:
- Slide 22: Routine PV infrastructure (AEMS, DAEN, daily/weekly analysis, workflow database)
- Slide 23: Safety Plan referenced with aspirational strategies
- Slide 24: Weekly COVID-19 safety reports

What was absent: Operational mechanisms distinguishing COVID-19 monitoring from routine systems. No AusVaxSafety integration, no Plan's 17 strategies, no governance structures, no performance metrics—despite technical training for professionals.
Four years later (October 2025), Senate testimony described the Plan as managed through "day-to-day processes" with no systematic tracking. OAIC searches found no Plan-specific implementation or governance records.

The gap: Teaching materials showed routine pharmacovigilance with Safety Plan referenced aspirationally. Neither teaching materials nor FOI/OAIC processes produced evidence (workplans, governance minutes, KPI tracking, integration records) demonstrating enhanced monitoring existed as a distinct framework—despite being the legal condition of provisional approval.

## ANAO audit history and the pharmacovigilance gap

The Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) has examined TGA several times since the mid‑1990s, with reports focused on prescription‑medicine evaluation, the regulation of non‑prescription and complementary medicines, manufacturer compliance and cost‑recovery arrangements. These audits have primarily assessed pre‑market evaluation, regulatory processes, enforcement and financial frameworks, rather than whether specific pharmacovigilance plans were implemented as designed or whether enhanced post‑market commitments were demonstrably delivered.

In 2021–22, ANAO conducted a performance audit of the national COVID‑19 vaccine rollout (*COVID‑19 Vaccines: Vaccine Development and Procurement, and Vaccine Rollout*, Report No. 3 2021‑22). That audit examined rollout efficiency and coordination, vaccine procurement and distribution logistics, TGA’s role in expediting regulatory approval, and high‑level communication and implementation challenges.

Crucially, that audit did **not** examine:

- Whether TGA’s specific pharmacovigilance commitments in the February 2021 COVID‑19 Vaccine Safety Monitoring Plan were implemented as designed.  
- Whether “enhanced” monitoring, distinct from routine surveillance, actually operated in practice.  
- Whether provisional‑approval conditions were verified and documented before vaccines transitioned to full registration.  
- Whether TGA’s records and decision trails met international pharmacovigilance standards (e.g. ICH E2E, CIOMS) for traceable audit trails from signal detection to regulatory action.

As a result, there is currently no independent assurance that the enhanced post‑market safety monitoring promised to Australians – and relied upon to justify provisional approval for 68 million doses – was ever implemented and documented to the standard expected of a national regulator.

This citizen audit is intended to help fill that oversight gap by providing:

- A structured, evidence‑based implementation assessment of the February 2021 Safety Monitoring Plan.  
- A clear mapping of documentation gaps around signal management, AusVaxSafety integration, provisional‑approval verification and governance.  
- A concrete evidentiary platform on which ANAO could scope and conduct a dedicated performance audit of TGA’s COVID‑19 vaccine pharmacovigilance system and its compliance with provisional‑approval conditions requiring enhanced post‑market safety monitoring.

Taken together, the scale of provisional use (68 million doses), the absence of a demonstrable implementation trail, and the lack of any prior ANAO examination of these specific pharmacovigilance issues provide a strong public‑interest basis for ANAO to initiate a focused performance audit.

## What This Audit Examines: Routine Pharmacovigilance vs Enhanced Safety Monitoring

### Enhanced Monitoring as Defined by the Plan

The COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Monitoring Plan (February 2021) is the authoritative source for what "enhanced monitoring" means in this context. This Plan was:

- **Cabinet-endorsed** as part of Australia's COVID-19 vaccine rollout strategy
- **Publicly promised** to Australian citizens as the framework for provisional approval oversight
- **Embedded in national vaccination policy** as the documented commitment for heightened safety surveillance
- **A legal condition** of provisional approval for vaccines with incomplete pre-market data

The Plan defines "enhanced monitoring" explicitly: **routine pharmacovigilance plus 17 numbered strategies** across five objectives designed to "strengthen the existing vaccine vigilance system." These 17 strategies constitute the operational definition of what TGA committed to deliver beyond business-as-usual surveillance.

This audit uses the Plan's own framework as the standard. When we ask whether "enhanced monitoring" was implemented, we mean: were these specific 17 strategies operationalised with verifiable documentation, or were they indistinguishable from routine operations?

---

### The Audit Question: Distinguishing Routine from Enhanced

This audit does not question whether safety monitoring occurred. It examines the absence of verifiable documentation demonstrating that the Plan's **17 numbered strategies** were systematically implemented as enhancements to routine pharmacovigilance.

**Routine pharmacovigilance** constitutes the baseline, mandated surveillance for all medicines: spontaneous adverse event reporting (e.g. DAEN), signal detection, regulatory actions, sponsor reporting, and international data exchange. The TGA conducted these activities during the rollout, evidenced by 148 safety signals investigated and 57 regulatory actions documented. The TGA also published more than 150 weekly safety reports to communicate findings.

**Enhanced safety monitoring**, as defined by the Plan, means routine pharmacovigilance **plus** the 17 specific strategies, including:

- Active surveillance through AusVaxSafety integration (Strategy 2.1)
- Systematic collaboration frameworks (Strategy 2.4)
- Integrated analysis of multiple data sources
- Product-specific investigation protocols
- Dedicated governance and performance tracking

For provisionally approved medicines, implementing these additional strategies was a non-negotiable condition of approval: earlier public access was granted in exchange for demonstrably stronger post-market safeguards beyond routine operations.

**Therefore, this audit asks:** Were the Plan's 17 numbered strategies operationalised through dedicated protocols and audit trails? Was AusVaxSafety's active surveillance systematically integrated with TGA signal management, as Strategies 2.1 and 2.4 required? Was implementation tracked and governed, or—consistent with later descriptions of "day-to-day processes"—were these strategies operationally indistinguishable from routine pharmacovigilance?

This question is critical. Approximately 68 million COVID-19 vaccine doses (around 94 per cent of the total rollout) were administered under provisional approval by late 2023, which legally required enhanced monitoring. If the Plan's 17 strategies cannot be distinguished from routine pharmacovigilance in the documentary record, then:

- Provisional approval conditions cannot be verified as met
- Public assurances of heightened oversight are unsubstantiated
- The integrity of the provisional approval pathway is compromised
- Fundamental accountability is impaired

This assessment does not critique routine pharmacovigilance activities. It examines whether the **17 additional strategies** legally required and publicly promised in February 2021 were implemented with the documentation, governance, and verifiable audit trails necessary for independent accountability.

## The Challenge of Black Box Governance for Private Citizens

This audit begins with a contradiction that defines its entire scope: The TGA promised a verifiable 'enhanced' system as a legal condition for provisional approval. Four years later, it described that system as undocumented 'day-to-day' processes. Our task is to investigate the gap between that promise and that description using the limited tools of a citizen. We confront the fundamental accountability problem of information asymmetry: regulators hold complete knowledge of internal processes while citizens see only outputs. When the TGA announced "enhanced safety monitoring," it created a definitional crisis: where does routine pharmacovigilance end and enhanced monitoring begin?

For private citizens with limited resources, funding, and investigative powers, this creates an impossible research challenge. Yet patterns emerge that demand explanation—even when definitive proof remains beyond citizen reach.

This audit employs transparent methodology: open access, version control, responsiveness to correction, and explicit limitations. It acknowledges inherent uncertainties while demonstrating what can be verified from outside the black box. [Read more: Black Box Governance](black-box-governance.md)

## Methodology and Evidence Base


### Assessment Framework


This audit applies systematic principles drawn from:

- **ISO 19011:2018 – Guidelines for auditing management systems**  
  - Evidence‑based approach.  
  - Independence and due professional care.  
  - Fair presentation of findings and limitations.

- **ANAO better‑practice guidance**  
  - Assessment against published plans and criteria.  
  - Triangulation across multiple sources.  
  - Emphasis on accountability and transparency.

**Regulatory frameworks applied**

- *Therapeutic Goods Act 1989* (provisional approval provisions) and TGA's provisional registration guidance documents
- TGA guidance on provisional approval pathways and Risk Management Plans.  
- Australian Regulatory Guidelines for Prescription Medicines (ARGPM).  
- International pharmacovigilance standards: ICH E2E, CIOMS, EMA GVP Module I.  
- Commonwealth records‑management and performance‑reporting frameworks: PGPA Act 2013, Archives Act 1983.

### Evidence Hierarchy


Each of the 20 Plan outputs was evaluated using a four‑tier hierarchy:

- **Level 1 (highest):** Published reports, AusPARs, peer‑reviewed literature, official databases with independent verification.  
- **Level 2:** Government websites, official media releases, committee minutes, annual/performance reports.  
- **Level 3:** FOI decisions and schedules, OAIC submissions and decisions, Senate testimony, official correspondence.  
- **Level 4 (lowest):** Unsubstantiated claims without supporting documentation.

**Rating criteria**

- “**Fully implemented**” requires coherent end‑to‑end documentation showing that required processes, integrations, governance arrangements and outputs were in place and sustained over time.  
- Partial completion of activities without an implementation trail is rated “**partially implemented**”, not “fully implemented”.

## Limitations and Falsifiability


**Scope**

This audit assesses **documented evidence only**. It does **not** evaluate clinical safety or efficacy of COVID‑19 vaccines, nor the appropriateness of individual regulatory decisions. Findings concern documentation, records management and governance processes.

**Meaning of documentation gaps**

Absence of documentation does not prove that activities never occurred. It does, however:

- Prevent independent verification of TGA’s assurances about “enhanced” monitoring.  
- Raise questions about transparency, accountability and compliance with international pharmacovigilance standards requiring systematic documentation.  
- Indicate potential non‑compliance with Commonwealth record‑keeping and performance‑reporting obligations.

**Why the gaps are significant**

The probability that comprehensive implementation documentation exists but could not be located is low, given:

1. TGA has demonstrated the ability to classify 2,218+ pages of Plan‑aligned material for OAIC (MR22/00538, September 2024).  
2. Senate testimony confirmed that Plan implementation was never systematically tracked and that monitoring was treated as “day‑to‑day processes”.  
3. Multiple FOI requests over four years (FOI 3643, FOI 25‑0166) targeted the same implementation evidence.  
4. Systematic review of publicly available TGA databases, websites, annual reports and AusPARs found no Plan‑level implementation or verification trail.

**Falsifiability**

The methodology is explicitly falsifiable: any finding can be disproved by production of contradicting documentation. Corrections and additional evidence are welcomed, and would be incorporated into future versions with transparent version history.

## Oversight and Accountability

This assessment has been provided to multiple oversight bodies:

- **Australian National Audit Office (ANAO)** – submitted 27 November 2025, requesting a dedicated performance audit of TGA’s COVID‑19 vaccine pharmacovigilance implementation and compliance with provisional‑approval conditions.  
- **Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee** – provided to members to inform questioning and oversight; key findings were confirmed in principle through testimony on 9 October 2025.  
- **Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC)** – central to reviews MR22/00538 and MR25/01153, and the 2025 AICmr 54 decision.  
- **Commonwealth Ombudsman** – complaint submitted 1 April 2025 (ref: 2025‑806374) regarding contradictions in TGA responses and systemic issues in pharmacovigilance governance and FOI administration.

## The Call for Investigation


Australia administered 68 million COVID‑19 vaccine doses under provisional approval – the country’s largest deployment of provisionally approved medicines. Provisional approval was justified on the basis that **enhanced, documented post‑market monitoring** would compensate for limited pre‑market data.

After four years of systematic FOI requests and documentary review, TGA has not demonstrated that:

- It systematically implemented the enhanced monitoring framework described in the February 2021 Plan.  
- Enhanced monitoring was distinct from routine “day‑to‑day processes”, as provisional approval requires.  
- It maintained audit trails linking 148 investigated signals to 57 regulatory actions, as international standards envisage.  
- It verified, and documented verification of, provisional‑approval conditions before 68 million doses transitioned to full registration.  
- It established the governance, oversight and performance‑measurement arrangements its own Plan indicated.

The problem is straightforward: **TGA made commitments to 26 million Australians about enhanced, documented safety monitoring. It cannot, on the record, show that those commitments were kept.** This gap in demonstrable accountability requires formal, independent investigation and reform of pharmacovigilance and provisional‑approval frameworks.

## Disclaimer and Declaration


### Scope and Intent

This audit assesses documented evidence of plan implementation and does not question the competence, good faith, or professional conduct of TGA staff or partner organisations. Staff may have worked diligently within resource constraints, organisational structures, or system limitations beyond their control. 

The findings concern systemic documentation, records management, and governance processes—not individual performance or intent. The absence of documentation may reflect organisational capacity issues, competing priorities during an emergency response, or records-management system limitations rather than deliberate non-implementation.

This distinction is important: even if staff worked conscientiously within existing systems, the documentation gap remains a governance concern requiring independent assessment to verify compliance with provisional approval conditions and international pharmacovigilance standards.

### Scope of Assessment

This assessment evaluates publicly available evidence for implementation of TGA’s COVID‑19 Vaccine Safety Monitoring Plan commitments. It does **not** assess the clinical safety or efficacy of COVID‑19 vaccines, nor the appropriateness of individual regulatory decisions. The findings relate to documentation, records management and governance processes, not clinical or scientific judgements.

### Peer‑Review Status

This work has not yet been peer‑reviewed or independently verified. It is published to encourage independent verification, peer review and scrutiny by researchers, citizens, oversight bodies and other interested parties. Corrections and additional evidence are welcomed.

### Accuracy and Good Faith

## Disclaimer

This independent audit is conducted and published in the public interest, consistent with principles of open government, parliamentary oversight, and 
citizen-led accountability. It examines institutional processes and documentary evidence related to the implementation of government policy and regulatory 
frameworks. The purpose is to inform public and parliamentary understanding and to contribute to accountability and transparency in government administration.

The audit does not attribute misconduct or wrongdoing to any individual, question the professional competence or integrity of officials, or suggest deliberate misrepresentation by any person or organisation. References to named individuals reflect standard documentation practices, citing who presented information in their official capacity as identified in public source materials.

The focus is exclusively on identifying and analysing gaps between published frameworks and verifiable records—not on the actions or intentions of any individual or partner organisation.

**Commitment to Accuracy:** If any inadvertent mischaracterisation of fact, evidence, or the position of any individual or entity is identified, it will be promptly reviewed and corrected. Feedback is welcomed via the project's GitHub repository.

**Copyright & Fair Dealing:** The use of source materials, including Crown Copyright documents, is for the purpose of non-commercial research, criticism, review, and public interest analysis pursuant to fair dealing provisions of the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth).
