# TGA COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Monitoring Plan - Implementation Audit

## Overview

Independent assessment of documented implementation of Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Monitoring Plan published February 2021.

This audit evaluates publicly available evidence for 24 specific outputs and activities mandated in the TGA's plan after four years of implementation (February 2021 - February 2025).

## Key Findings

**Implementation Status (24 Plan Outputs Assessed):**
- **21% Fully Documented** (5/24 outputs)
- **54% Partial/Undocumented** (13/24 outputs)  
- **25% No Evidence** (6/24 outputs)

**Critical Gaps Identified:**
- Active surveillance system enhancements: No public documentation
- Weekly causality assessments: No evidence of systematic process
- International collaboration outputs: Minimal documentation
- Public transparency commitments: Substantially unfulfilled

## Methodology

**Evidence Hierarchy Classification:**
- **Level 1** (Highest): Published reports, peer-reviewed literature, official databases
- **Level 2**: Government websites, media releases, committee minutes  
- **Level 3**: FOI responses, parliamentary answers
- **Level 4** (Lowest): TGA claims without supporting documentation

**Assessment Criteria:**
Each of 24 plan outputs evaluated against publicly available evidence using systematic documentation review, FOI requests (2021-2025), and verification against TGA's own statements to oversight bodies.

## Context

This audit was conducted following four years of Freedom of Information (FOI) requests seeking documentation of TGA's implementation of its published safety monitoring plan. The assessment has been:

- **Submitted to**: Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) requesting performance audit
- **Provided to**: Members of Parliament for oversight purposes
- **Reviewed by**: Information Commissioner (multiple matters: MR22/00538, MR25/01153)
- **Documented in**: Commonwealth Ombudsman complaints regarding response contradictions

## Key Accountability Concerns

**Documentary Evidence Contradictions:**
TGA demonstrated capability to classify and organize 2,218+ pages of vaccine safety monitoring documentation for Information Commissioner review, while simultaneously claiming identical classification tasks were "too subjective" for citizen FOI access.

**Temporal Pattern:**
- Feb 2022: TGA claims requested documents "don't exist"
- Mar 2022: TGA acknowledges "ample documentation" exists  
- 2022-2023: TGA organizes extensive documentation for IC review
- 2024-2025: TGA refuses citizen access citing subjective classification

**Public Interest Implications:**
Plan promised "transparent communication" but implementation reveals systemic gaps between stated commitments and documented delivery, raising questions about accountability mechanisms for public health monitoring systems.

## Verification

All findings are verifiable through:
- TGA's published February 2021 Safety Monitoring Plan
- TGA public websites and databases (accessed 2021-2025)
- FOI request responses (FOI 3094, FOI 3095, FOI 3176, FOI 3869, FOI 4698)
- Information Commissioner decisions and reviews
- Parliamentary committee records and Hansard
- Published peer-reviewed literature

No classified or confidential information is included. All source material either publicly available or obtained through lawful FOI processes.

## Limitations

This audit assesses **documented evidence only**. Absence of documentation does not prove activities did not occur, but raises questions about:
- Public transparency and accountability
- Verification of safety monitoring claims
- Alignment between promised and delivered outputs
- Accessibility of evidence for independent review

## Research Context

This audit methodology builds on systematic analysis of regulatory transparency and documentation standards. Related investigative reporting on TGA vaccine safety monitoring documentation gaps:
