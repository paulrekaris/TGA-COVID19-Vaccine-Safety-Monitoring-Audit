# TGA COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Monitoring Plan - Implementation Audit

## Overview

Independent assessment of documented implementation of Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Monitoring Plan published February 2021.

This audit evaluates publicly available evidence for 24 specific outputs and activities mandated in the TGA's plan after four years of implementation (February 2021 - February 2025).

## Key Findings

**Implementation Status (24 Plan Outputs Assessed):**
- **21% Fully Documented** (5/24 outputs)
- **54% Partial/Undocumented** (13/24 outputs)  
- **25% No Evidence** (6/24 outputs)

**Critical Gaps Identified:**
- Active surveillance system enhancements: No public documentation
- Weekly causality assessments: No evidence of systematic process
- International collaboration outputs: Minimal documentation
- Public transparency commitments: Substantially unfulfilled

## Methodology

This assessment applies systematic audit principles drawn from ISO 19011:2018 (Guidelines for auditing management systems) and Australian National Audit Office better practice guidance. The approach emphasises evidence-based analysis, systematic documentation review, and objective evaluation against stated commitments.

ISO 19011 principles applied include: integrity (reliance on verifiable evidence), fair presentation (accurate reporting of findings), due professional care (systematic methodology), independence (evaluation against TGA's own standards), and evidence-based approach (findings supported by documented sources). ANAO principles applied include assessment against published plans, verification through multiple evidence sources, and focus on accountability and transparency in public administration.

The audit methodology mapped TGA's 24 plan outputs against TGA's Australian Regulatory Guidelines for Prescription Medicines (ARGPM), international pharmacovigilance standards (ICH E2E, EMA GVP Module I), and Commonwealth records management requirements (PGPA Act 2013, Archives Act 1983). Provisional approval processes were benchmarked against comparable frameworks from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA).

**Evidence Hierarchy Classification:**
- **Level 1** (Highest): Published reports, peer-reviewed literature, official databases
- **Level 2**: Government websites, media releases, committee minutes  
- **Level 3**: FOI responses, parliamentary answers
- **Level 4** (Lowest): TGA claims without supporting documentation

**Assessment Criteria:**
Each of 24 plan outputs evaluated against publicly available evidence using systematic documentation review, FOI requests (2021-2025), and verification against TGA's own statements to oversight bodies. The methodology is falsifiable—any finding can be disproved through production of contradicting documentation by TGA. All source material is publicly available or obtained through lawful FOI processes, enabling independent replication of findings.

## Context

This audit was conducted following four years of Freedom of Information (FOI) requests seeking documentation of TGA's implementation of its published safety monitoring plan. The assessment has been:

- **Submitted to**: Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) requesting performance audit
- **Provided to**: Members of Parliament for oversight purposes
- **Reviewed by**: Information Commissioner (multiple matters: MR22/00538, MR25/01153)
- **Documented in**: Commonwealth Ombudsman complaints regarding response contradictions

## ANAO Audit History and the Pharmacovigilance Gap

The Australian National Audit Office has examined the TGA several times since the mid-1990s, focusing on prescription drug evaluation, regulation of non-prescription and complementary medicines, manufacturer compliance, and application of cost-recovery principles. These audits primarily assessed pre-market evaluation, regulatory processes, enforcement, and financial frameworks, rather than whether specific pharmacovigilance plans were implemented as designed. To date there has been no dedicated ANAO performance audit of TGA's COVID-19 vaccine pharmacovigilance system or of its compliance with provisional approval conditions requiring "enhanced" post-market safety monitoring. This report is intended to help fill that gap by providing an independent implementation audit of the COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Monitoring Plan.

## Key Accountability Concerns

**Documentary Evidence Contradictions:**
TGA demonstrated capability to classify and organize 2,218+ pages of vaccine safety monitoring documentation for Information Commissioner review, while simultaneously claiming identical classification tasks were "too subjective" for citizen FOI access.

**Temporal Pattern:**
- Feb 2022: TGA claims requested documents "don't exist"
- Mar 2022: TGA acknowledges "ample documentation" exists  
- 2022-2023: TGA organizes extensive documentation for IC review
- 2024-2025: TGA refuses citizen access citing subjective classification

**Public Interest Implications:**
Plan promised "transparent communication" but implementation reveals systemic gaps between stated commitments and documented delivery, raising questions about accountability mechanisms for public health monitoring systems.

## Verification

All findings are verifiable through:
- TGA's published February 2021 Safety Monitoring Plan
- TGA public websites and databases (accessed 2021-2025)
- FOI request responses (FOI 3094, FOI 3095, FOI 3176, FOI 3869, FOI 4698)
- Information Commissioner decisions and reviews
- Parliamentary committee records and Hansard
- Published peer-reviewed literature

No classified or confidential information is included. All source material either publicly available or obtained through lawful FOI processes.

## Limitations

This audit assesses **documented evidence only**. Absence of documentation does not prove activities did not occur, but raises questions about:
- Public transparency and accountability
- Verification of safety monitoring claims
- Alignment between promised and delivered outputs
- Accessibility of evidence for independent review

## Research Context

## Disclaimer and Declaration

This assessment evaluates publicly available evidence for implementation of stated commitments in TGA's published COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Monitoring Plan. It does not assess the clinical safety or efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, nor the appropriateness of individual regulatory decisions.

The findings relate to documentation, records management, and governance processes—not clinical or scientific judgements. The assessment is based exclusively on TGA's own documents and statements.

**Full research methodology, limitations, key assumptions, and assessment criteria are outlined in the detailed audit report available in this repository.**

**This work has not been peer-reviewed or independently verified.** It is made publicly available to encourage independent verification, peer review, and scrutiny by other researchers, citizens, oversight bodies, and interested parties. The author welcomes correction of any errors or production of contradicting evidence.

This analysis is based on extensive review of available documentation and is accurate to the best of my knowledge. Given the substantial volume of materials examined, inadvertent errors in citation or interpretation may occur. Corrections are welcomed.

I declare that the information in this assessment is accurate to the best of my knowledge. All factual claims are supported by documented evidence with source citations. This work is conducted in good faith in the public interest.

The problem documented is simple: after four years, the TGA cannot demonstrate that promises made to 26 million Australians were kept. This requires investigation.
