# TGA COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Monitoring Plan - Implementation Audit

## Introduction

Between February 2021 and November 2023, Australia administered approximately 63.8 million COVID-19 vaccine doses under provisional approval requiring enhanced safety monitoring. The Therapeutic Goods Administration published a comprehensive COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Monitoring Plan in February 2021, outlining 24 specific outputs and activities to ensure rigorous pharmacovigilance during this unprecedented vaccination programme.

This citizen-led independent audit provides the first known systematic assessment of plan implementation using publicly available evidence and fully replicable, falsifiable methodology based on ISO 19011:2018 audit principles, Australian National Audit Office better practice guidance, and international pharmacovigilance standards adopted by TGA (ICH E2E) and internationally recognised best practice (CIOMS).

Compliance with the published plan was particularly critical given provisional approval requirements under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989. Three COVID-19 vaccines received provisional approval during this period: Pfizer/BioNTech Comirnaty (January 2021), AstraZeneca Vaxzevria (February 2021), and Moderna Spikevax (August 2021). Provisional approval is granted when traditional evidence requirements cannot be met but there is a clear public health need, with enhanced post-market monitoring serving as a key safeguard. The Safety Monitoring Plan represented TGA's documented commitment to enhanced pharmacovigilance as a condition of provisional approval for these vaccines.

After four years of Freedom of Information requests seeking documentation of the plan's implementation, systematic contradictions emerged in TGA's responses—ranging from claims that requested documents "don't exist" to acknowledgement of "ample documentation," followed by refusal of access on grounds of subjective classification difficulty, despite TGA's demonstrated capability to organise 2,218+ pages by plan objectives for Information Commissioner review.

This repository provides a comprehensive, independent implementation audit using ISO 19011:2018 audit principles and Australian National Audit Office better practice guidance, creating a permanent, open-access record to enable independent verification, peer review, parliamentary oversight, and formal independent inquiry.

## Key Findings

### Context: Monitoring Activity Practice vs Enhanced Implementation Requirement

TGA conducted substantial safety monitoring activities during 2021-2025, including investigation of 148 safety signals and 57 regulatory actions (Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee, October 2025).

This audit does not question whether monitoring activities occurred. This audit examines whether those activities constituted the enhanced monitoring beyond routine pharmacovigilance required as a condition of provisional approval.

The assessment examines publicly available evidence for 24 specific outputs and activities mandated in TGA's plan over four years (February 2021 - November 2025).

### The Critical Audit Trail Gap

While TGA investigated 148 safety signals and took 57 regulatory actions during the provisional approval period (Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee, October 2025), critical documentation gaps prevent verification of the regulatory decision-making process:

**Missing Documentation:**

- No published audit trails linking specific safety signals to specific regulatory actions
- No documentation of investigation protocols applied to each signal
- No evidence of decision-making criteria used to determine actions or no action outcomes
- No explanation for the disposition of 91 investigated signals (148 signals investigated minus 57 actions taken)

**International Standards Requirement**

International pharmacovigilance standards adopted by TGA (ICH E2E) and internationally recognised best practice (CIOMS) require traceable audit trails from signal detection through assessment to regulatory decision. The absence of this documentation means:

- The enhanced monitoring framework implementation cannot be verified
- Compliance with provisional approval conditions cannot be demonstrated
- Regulatory decision-making processes remain opaque despite significant public health implications

TGA officials characterised this monitoring work as "day-to-day processes" rather than enhanced monitoring tracked against plan objectives (Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee, October 2025). This characterisation, combined with the documentation gaps, raises fundamental questions about whether provisional approval requirements for demonstrable enhanced monitoring were met.

### Implementation Status

**Implementation Status:**

- **21% Fully Documented** (5/24 outputs)
- **54% Partial/Undocumented** (13/24 outputs)  
- **25% No Evidence** (6/24 outputs)

**Critical Gaps Identified:**

- Active surveillance system enhancements: No public documentation
- Weekly causality assessments: No evidence of systematic process
- International collaboration outputs: Minimal documentation
- Public transparency commitments: Substantially unfulfilled
- Signal investigation audit trails: No documentation linking 148 signals to 57 actions

**Note on Monitoring Activity**

TGA investigated 148 safety signals and took 57 regulatory actions during this period (Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee, October 2025). However, officials characterised this work as "day-to-day processes" rather than enhanced monitoring tracked against plan objectives. Additionally, TGA has not published documentation linking specific signals to specific regulatory actions, investigation protocols applied, or decision-making criteria used—documentation required by international pharmacovigilance standards adopted by TGA (ICH E2E) and internationally recognised best practice (CIOMS). The gaps identified above relate to documented implementation of enhanced processes, not absence of monitoring activity.

## **The Central Finding**

Four years after publishing its COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Monitoring Plan, the TGA cannot demonstrate through documentation that it systematically implemented the enhanced monitoring it promised. TGA officials admitted to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee that implementation was never systematically tracked by plan objectives, instead treating it as routine "day-to-day processes." This contradicts provisional approval requirements, which mandate demonstrable, trackable enhanced monitoring—not standard business-as-usual surveillance.

**Provisional Approval Requirements Not Demonstrably Met**

Provisional approval under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 requires enhanced post-market monitoring as a legal condition. The TGA's admission that implementation was never systematically tracked and treated as routine "day-to-day processes" means compliance with provisional approval conditions cannot be verified. Without documented, trackable enhanced monitoring distinct from routine surveillance—including audit trails required by international standards (ICH E2E, CIOMS) linking the 148 investigated signals to 57 regulatory actions—the legal requirements for provisional approval were not demonstrably met during Australia's largest medical intervention in history. **The documented evidence, and systematic absence thereof, reveals a significant historical regulatory failure in pharmaceutical safety monitoring that violates international pharmacovigilance standards requiring traceable audit trails and documented decision-making processes.**

**Key Contradictions**

TGA demonstrated capability to classify and organise 2,218+ pages of vaccine safety monitoring documentation by Safety Plan objectives for Information Commissioner review (MR22/00538: September 2024), yet nine months later claimed that identical classification tasks were "too subjective" and required "subjective interpretation" for citizen FOI access (FOI 25-0166 refusal decision, June 2025). TGA officials testified to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee (9 October 2025) that the plan's key themes "essentially describe our day-to-day processes" rather than separately tracked objectives, and acknowledged that producing documents by objective would involve "some difficulty" and a "vast volume of documents." Despite reporting 148 safety signals investigated and 57 regulatory or consumer information actions taken, TGA has not published, nor released under FOI, documentation that links individual signals to specific actions or provides the signal-by-signal audit trails envisaged in international pharmacovigilance standards (e.g. ICH E2E, CIOMS).

**Timeline of Contradictory Positions:**

- **February 2022:** TGA claims requested documents "don't exist"
- **March 2022:** TGA acknowledges "ample documentation" exists 
- **2022-2023:** TGA organises extensive documentation for Information Commissioner review
- **October 2025:** TGA confirms to Senate implementation was never systematically tracked and characterises 148 signal investigations and 57 actions as "day-to-day processes"
- **2024-2025:** TGA refuses citizen access citing subjective classification

**Every possible explanation points to regulatory failure:**

1. The monitoring wasn't conducted as a structured programme with audit trails meeting international standards
2. Records are too disorganised to retrieve despite capability to organise 2,218+ pages for Information Commissioner
3. Documents were never systematically maintained as required by international pharmacovigilance standards (ICH E2E, CIOMS)

## Methodology

This assessment applies systematic audit principles drawn from ISO 19011:2018 (Guidelines for auditing management systems) and Australian National Audit Office better practice guidance. The approach emphasises evidence-based analysis, systematic documentation review, and objective evaluation against stated commitments.

**Audit Principles Applied**

ISO 19011 principles include: integrity (foundation of professionalism), fair presentation (accurate reporting of findings), due professional care (systematic methodology and judgement), independence (evaluation against TGA's own standards), evidence-based approach (findings supported by objective, verifiable evidence), confidentiality (protection of information), and risk-based approach (considering risks and opportunities). ANAO audit practices include assessment against published plans, verification through multiple evidence sources, and emphasis on accountability and transparency in public administration.

This audit methodology systematically applies ISO 19011 principles and ANAO practices, as demonstrated through evidence-based classification of all 24 Safety Plan outputs against TGA's published commitments, verified via multiple official sources with full limitations disclosed.

**Regulatory Frameworks**

The audit methodology mapped TGA's 24 plan outputs against TGA's Australian Regulatory Guidelines for Prescription Medicines (ARGPM), international pharmacovigilance standards (ICH E2E, CIOMS, EMA GVP Module I), and Commonwealth records management requirements (PGPA Act 2013, Archives Act 1983). Provisional approval processes were benchmarked against comparable frameworks from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA).

**Evidence Hierarchy:**
- **Level 1** (Highest): Published reports, peer-reviewed literature, official databases
- **Level 2**: Government websites, media releases, committee minutes 
- **Level 3**: FOI responses, parliamentary answers
- **Level 4** (Lowest): TGA claims without supporting documentation

**Assessment Criteria**

Each of 24 plan outputs evaluated against publicly available evidence using systematic documentation review, FOI requests (2022-2025), and verification against TGA's own statements to oversight bodies. The methodology is falsifiable—any finding can be disproved through production of contradicting documentation by TGA. All source material is publicly available or obtained through lawful FOI processes, enabling independent replication of findings.

## Context and Oversight Engagement

This audit was conducted following four years of Freedom of Information (FOI) requests seeking documentation of TGA's implementation of its published safety monitoring plan. The assessment has been:

- **Submitted to**: Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) on 27 November 2024, requesting performance audit
- **Provided to**: Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee and Members of Parliament for oversight purposes
- **Reviewed by**: Information Commissioner (multiple matters: MR22/00538, MR25/01153)
- **Documented in**: Commonwealth Ombudsman complaint submitted 1 April 2025 (ref: 2025-806374) regarding response contradictions and systemic pharmacovigilance governance and compliance issues

**ANAO Audit History and the Pharmacovigilance Gap**

The Australian National Audit Office has examined the TGA several times since the mid-1990s, focusing on prescription drug evaluation, regulation of non-prescription and complementary medicines, manufacturer compliance, and cost-recovery principles. These audits primarily assessed pre-market evaluation, regulatory processes, enforcement, and financial frameworks, rather than whether specific pharmacovigilance plans were implemented as designed. 

To date there has been no dedicated ANAO performance audit of TGA's COVID-19 vaccine pharmacovigilance system or of its compliance with provisional approval conditions requiring "enhanced" post-market safety monitoring. This report is intended to help fill that gap by providing an independent implementation audit and evidence supporting a formal ANAO performance audit.

## Verification and Limitations

All findings are verifiable through:

- TGA's published February 2021 Safety Monitoring Plan: https://www.tga.gov.au/sites/default/files/covid-19-vaccine-safety-monitoring-plan.pdf
- TGA public websites and databases (accessed 2021-2025)
- FOI request responses (FOI 3643, FOI 25-0166)
- TGA submissions to Information Commissioner (MR22/00538 - July 2022, September 2024)
- Information Commissioner decisions and reviews (MR22/00538, MR25/01153, 2025 AICmr 54)
- Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee testimony (9 October 2025): https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Hansard/Hansard_Display?bid=committees/estimate/29000/&sid=0003
- Parliamentary committee records and Hansard
- Published peer-reviewed literature

No classified or confidential information is included. All source material either publicly available or obtained through lawful FOI processes.

**Limitations**

This audit assesses documented evidence only. Absence of documentation does not prove activities did not occur, but raises questions about public transparency and accountability, verification of safety monitoring claims, alignment between promised and delivered outputs, and accessibility of evidence for independent review.

However, the statistical probability that relevant documentation exists but could not be located is negligible given: 

1. **TGA's demonstrated capability** to organise and classify 2,218+ pages of vaccine safety monitoring documentation by Safety Plan objectives for Information Commissioner review MR22/00538 (September 2024)
2. **TGA officials' testimony** to Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee, that the plan's key themes "essentially describe our day-to-day processes" rather than separately tracked objectives, with acknowledgement that producing such documents would involve "some difficulty" and a "vast volume of documents" (9 October 2025)—and confirmation that 148 safety signals were investigated resulting in 57 regulatory actions, yet no documentation links specific signals to specific actions
3. **Multiple FOI requests** over four years targeting the same documentation (FOI 3643, FOI 25-0166)
4. **Systematic review** of all publicly available TGA databases, websites, and published materials

If documentation implementing the Safety Plan exists, TGA has had multiple opportunities and clear incentive to produce it.

## Disclaimer and Declaration

This assessment evaluates publicly available evidence for implementation of the commitments in the TGA COVID‑19 Vaccine Safety Monitoring Plan. It does not assess the clinical safety or efficacy of COVID‑19 vaccines, nor the appropriateness of individual regulatory decisions. The findings relate to documentation, records management and governance processes, not to clinical or scientific judgements. The assessment is based exclusively on TGA’s own documents and official statements.

Full research methodology, limitations, key assumptions and assessment criteria are outlined in the detailed audit report available in this repository.

**This work has not been peer‑reviewed or independently verified.** It is made publicly available to encourage independent verification, peer review and scrutiny by other researchers, citizens, oversight bodies and interested parties. The author welcomes correction of any errors or production of contradicting evidence.

This analysis is based on extensive review of available documentation and is accurate to the best of the author’s knowledge. Given the substantial volume of materials examined, inadvertent errors in citation or interpretation may occur; corrections are welcomed.

This is a living, evidence‑based implementation audit. It will be updated as new official documents (for example FOI and OAIC material) or substantive analytical feedback become available, while maintaining a transparent version history so changes to the evidence base and interpretation are clear to readers. Later versions may incorporate additional documents and clarifications, but the core findings and ratings have remained consistent across versions to date.

The author declares that the information in this assessment is accurate to the best of their knowledge and that all factual claims are supported by documented evidence with source citations. This work is conducted in good faith and in the public interest.

**The problem documented is simple: after four years, the TGA cannot demonstrate that promises made to 26 million Australians were kept. This requires investigation.**
