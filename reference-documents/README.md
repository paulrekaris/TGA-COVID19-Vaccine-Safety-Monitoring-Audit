### Australian COVID‑19 Vaccination Policy (November 2020)

  Commits the Australian Government to active and comprehensive post‑market safety monitoring for COVID‑19 vaccines and assigns adverse event monitoring “via the TGA” through a national COVID‑19 Vaccine Pharmacovigilance Plan.

### TGA COVID‑19 Vaccine Safety Monitoring Plan (February 2021)

TGA’s published COVID‑19 Vaccine Safety Monitoring Plan (February 2021). This is the primary source document against which implementation was assessed.

The audit methodology mapped the Plan’s outputs against:

- TGA’s Australian Regulatory Guidelines for Prescription Medicines (ARGPM)  
- International pharmacovigilance standards (ICH E2E, CIOMS, EMA GVP Module I)  
- Commonwealth records‑management requirements (PGPA Act 2013, Archives Act 1983)

Provisional‑approval processes were benchmarked against comparable frameworks from:

- US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  
- European Medicines Agency (EMA)

### AusVaxSafety – Active and enhanced vaccine safety surveillance for COVID‑19 vaccines in Australia (February 2021)

  https://www.ausvaxsafety.org.au/active-and-enhanced-vaccine-safety-surveillance-covid-19-vaccines-australia  
  Describes AusVaxSafety as operating “as part of the national COVID‑19 Vaccine Pharmacovigilance Plan, led by the TGA and the Australian Government”, complementing TGA and state/territory spontaneous reporting systems.

  > Active, SMS‑based post‑vaccination surveillance data for COVID‑19 vaccines in Australia, including cumulative counts of invitations sent, responses received, self‑reported adverse events and medical‑attendance rates. Used in this audit for estimates of approximately 6.8 million survey responses, ~3 million adverse‑event reports and ~62,000 reports of medical attention.

### Victorian COVID-19 Vaccination Program Implementation Plan (19 February 2021)
Available at: <https://federalfinancialrelations.gov.au/sites/federalfinancialrelations.gov.au/files/2021-04/vic_vaccine_plan.pdf>

Formal bilateral agreement between Commonwealth and Victoria establishing governance framework for vaccine rollout. Demonstrates that COVID-19 vaccination program operated under structured intergovernmental agreements requiring formal implementation processes and documentation—reinforcing audit finding that enhanced monitoring was not routine business but required systematic framework with traceable records. 

This directly contradicts Senate testimony by senior TGA officials (9 October 2025) claiming monitoring was managed through "day-to-day processes" rather than systematic tracking against plan objectives.

### Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee testimony transcript excerpts

Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee testimony (9 October 2025) where TGA officials confirmed that implementation of the Safety Monitoring Plan was “never systematically tracked” by Plan objective, described monitoring as “day‑to‑day processes”, and reported 148 signals investigated and 57 regulatory actions.

AusPARs documenting the transition of Comirnaty and Spikevax from provisional to full registration. These reports record TGA’s regulatory decisions and summarise clinical and safety data, and were reviewed for any evidence of verification against the February 2021 Safety Monitoring Plan or explicit sign‑off of enhanced‑monitoring conditions.

### TGA performance reports

TGA corporate performance reports reviewed to identify any Plan‑related outputs, indicators or performance measures. These documents provide the official performance‑reporting context against which the absence of Safety Monitoring Plan implementation metrics is assessed.

### Summary

**FOI 5082 Request:** TGA's internal documents on "COVID-19 vaccine pharmacovigilance"—specifically vaccine safety monitoring systems, signal detection methods, and operational SOPs (~2019–2021).

**Documents Released:** 

Internal blueprint documenting routine pharmacovigilance baseline (January 2019–early 2020) with COVID-19 signal detection implementation docs (July–August 2021). Documents routine "spontaneous reporting → assessment → action" framework (AEMS/DAEN/DPAR, VSIG for clusters) predating Safety Plan by 12–24 months. Contextualises Senate testimony characterisation of "day-to-day processes." 

Post-Plan COVID implementation docs (observed-vs-expected, MaxSPRT, enhanced DPAR frequency) documented **without any reference to Safety Plan integration, compliance frameworks, or mapping to Plan's specified strategies**. No signal-to-action workflows or comprehensive AusVaxSafety protocols documented. Demonstrates baseline infrastructure and COVID-specific methodological adaptations implemented independently of documented Plan requirements. Does not address post-Plan implementation gaps (FOI 25-0166, MR22/00538 null results).

**Significance:**

**Critical evidentiary significance:** FOI 5082 demonstrates TGA's established capacity and practice of detailed pharmacovigilance documentation when systems exist. Documents support "routine PV existed" and show COVID-specific methodological enhancements were implemented, but **contain zero evidence of Safety Plan integration or compliance**. The absence of Plan implementation documentation in FOI 5082—combined with null results for Plan-specific requests (FOI 25-0166, MR22/00538)—demonstrates this absence reflects non-implementation rather than non-documentation. Shows baseline "day-to-day processes" existed before Cabinet-endorsed enhanced framework was promised, but fails to demonstrate promised enhancements were ever implemented as documented Plan compliance.

### Content Analysis

**Slide 22: "How the TGA does this?"** - Detailed routine PV infrastructure:
- Adverse Event Management System (AEMS) database
- Database of Adverse Event Notifications (DAEN)
- Daily review of serious adverse events
- Weekly analysis for some vaccines (e.g. influenza)
- Bimonthly Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR) analysis
- Safety issues tracked through workflow database

**Slide 23: "PV in the times of COVID-19"** - References Safety Plan and lists aspirational strategies:
- Timely collection and management of adverse event reports
- Timely detection and investigation of safety signals
- Timely action to address safety concerns
- Timely communications to inform the public
- Close collaboration with vaccine safety stakeholders

**Slide 24:** Weekly COVID-19 vaccine safety reports shown as output

**Pattern:** Detailed routine PV infrastructure presented (Slide 22), but COVID-19 slide (23) shows only aspirational strategies without operational distinction from that routine infrastructure.

### Key Fact: The Omission of AusVaxSafety

The February 2021 COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Monitoring Plan explicitly designated the AusVaxSafety active surveillance system as a cornerstone of "enhanced" monitoring, critical for proactive signal detection and differentiating it from routine passive surveillance.

However, in this October 2021 training—delivered eight months into the rollout by the branch responsible for pharmacovigilance—AusVaxSafety is not mentioned. Slide 23 of the presentation, which specifically addresses "PV in the times of COVID-19" and lists "key strategies of the plan," describes only passive surveillance systems (AEMS/DAEN) and routine signal detection processes.

### Significance of the Omission

This omission is not minor; it is evidence of a disconnect between the published Plan and operational reality.

**Difficult to reconcile with the Plan's framework:**  
The Plan's "enhanced" monitoring was premised on integrated active surveillance. Its absence from operational training suggests the promised differentiated system was not being communicated as functional to frontline health professionals.

**Prefigures later characterisation:**  
This 2021 portrayal of COVID-19 monitoring as functionally indistinguishable from routine processes is directly consistent with the 2025 Senate testimony describing it as "day-to-day processes" never shown to have been systematically tracked against the Plan.

**Corroborates the audit finding:**  
The inability to point to specific, documented enhanced monitoring outputs in 2025 is prefigured here. The training describes aspirational goals ("aiming to enhance") rather than the 20 specified operational outputs listed in the Plan. This aligns with the audit's core finding: the documented, systematic implementation of "enhanced" monitoring cannot be verified.

### Conclusion

The October 2021 teaching materials are contemporaneous evidence that TGA's own characterisation of its monitoring framework to professionals did not reflect the integrated, active surveillance system promised in the Safety Plan. This is not speculation on why AusVaxSafety was omitted; the omission itself is a documented fact that supports the wider pattern of evidence: a gap between the promised "enhanced" system and the verifiable, documented reality of its execution.
