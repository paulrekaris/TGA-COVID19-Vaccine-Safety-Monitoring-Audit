### TGA COVID‑19 Vaccine Safety Monitoring Plan (February 2021)

TGA’s published COVID‑19 Vaccine Safety Monitoring Plan (February 2021). This is the primary source document against which implementation was assessed.

The audit methodology mapped the Plan’s outputs against:

- TGA’s Australian Regulatory Guidelines for Prescription Medicines (ARGPM)  
- International pharmacovigilance standards (ICH E2E, CIOMS, EMA GVP Module I)  
- Commonwealth records‑management requirements (PGPA Act 2013, Archives Act 1983)

Provisional‑approval processes were benchmarked against comparable frameworks from:

- US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  
- European Medicines Agency (EMA)

### Victorian COVID-19 Vaccination Program Implementation Plan (19 February 2021)
Available at: <https://federalfinancialrelations.gov.au/sites/federalfinancialrelations.gov.au/files/2021-04/vic_vaccine_plan.pdf>

Formal bilateral agreement between Commonwealth and Victoria establishing governance framework for vaccine rollout. Demonstrates that COVID-19 vaccination program operated under structured intergovernmental agreements requiring formal implementation processes and documentation—reinforcing audit finding that enhanced monitoring was not routine business but required systematic framework with traceable records. 

This directly contradicts Senate testimony by senior TGA officials (9 October 2025) claiming monitoring was managed through "day-to-day processes" rather than systematic tracking against plan objectives.

### Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee testimony transcript excerpts

Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee testimony (9 October 2025) where TGA officials confirmed that implementation of the Safety Monitoring Plan was “never systematically tracked” by Plan objective, described monitoring as “day‑to‑day processes”, and reported 148 signals investigated and 57 regulatory actions.

### Summary

**FOI 5082 Request:** TGA's internal documents on "COVID-19 vaccine pharmacovigilance"—specifically vaccine safety monitoring systems, signal detection methods, and operational SOPs (~2019–2021).

**Documents Released** 

Internal blueprint documenting routine pharmacovigilance baseline (January 2019–early 2020) with COVID-19 signal detection implementation docs (July–August 2021). Documents routine "spontaneous reporting → assessment → action" framework (AEMS/DAEN/DPAR, VSIG for clusters) predating Safety Plan by 12–24 months. Contextualises Senate testimony characterisation of "day-to-day processes." 

Post-Plan COVID implementation docs (observed-vs-expected, MaxSPRT, enhanced DPAR frequency) documented **without any reference to Safety Plan integration, compliance frameworks, or mapping to Plan's specified strategies**. No signal-to-action workflows or comprehensive AusVaxSafety protocols documented. Demonstrates baseline infrastructure and COVID-specific methodological adaptations implemented independently of documented Plan requirements. Does not address post-Plan implementation gaps (FOI 25-0166, MR22/00538 null results).

**Significance**

**Critical evidentiary significance:** FOI 5082 demonstrates TGA's established capacity and practice of detailed pharmacovigilance documentation when systems exist. Documents support "routine PV existed" and show COVID-specific methodological enhancements were implemented, but **contain zero evidence of Safety Plan integration or compliance**. The absence of Plan implementation documentation in FOI 5082—combined with null results for Plan-specific requests (FOI 25-0166, MR22/00538)—demonstrates this absence reflects non-implementation rather than non-documentation. Shows baseline "day-to-day processes" existed before Cabinet-endorsed enhanced framework was promised, but fails to demonstrate promised enhancements were ever implemented as documented Plan compliance.

### Key Evidence Documents

#### FOI 4029-03 - Advisory Committee on Vaccines Meeting 25 (29 September 2021)

TGA presentation to ACV of Strategy 2.3 methodology materials organised by Safety Plan objectives, including Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR) analysis and MaxSPRT approaches. Critical evidence: TGA presented Strategy 2.3 materials to advisory committee while concurrent public safety reports (September 2021 onwards) contained zero Strategy 2.3 references—establishing gap between internal advisory body transparency and public accountability.

#### FOI 4029-05 - VSIG Meeting Records

Vaccine Safety Investigation Group meeting records documenting signal investigation processes. Demonstrates internal signal investigation activity that was not reflected in public safety reporting framework.

#### FOI 4029-06 - VSIG Work Instruction v1.0 (January 2019)

Detailed work instruction from Pharmacovigilance and Special Access Branch documenting VSIG procedures, governance arrangements, causality assessment protocols, and multi-case investigation frameworks. Demonstrates TGA's established practice of documenting routine surveillance processes with detailed work instructions—making absence of equivalent COVID-19 Plan implementation documentation more significant.

### Supporting Evidence Documents

#### FOI 4029-01 - Advisory Committee on Vaccines Meeting 16 (30 September 2020)

Pre-rollout ACV meeting discussing draft COVID-19 Vaccine Pharmacovigilance Plan (22 September 2020). Documents expert committee endorsement of enhanced AEFI reporting, signal detection methodologies, VSIG appropriateness, and ATAGI coordination. Establishes that enhanced monitoring framework was planned and endorsed before rollout.

#### FOI 4029-02 - ACV Updates Post-Meeting 16

Updates following ACV Meeting 16 showing iterative development of Safety Monitoring Plan towards final February 2021 version.

#### FOI 4029-04 - VSIG Referral Data Template

Operational template for VSIG signal referrals, demonstrating systematic tools for signal management processes.

#### FOI 4029-07 - COVID Safety Reports Context

Documentation linking Safety Plan framework to public reporting processes, highlighting gaps between Plan commitments and public report content.

#### FOI 4029-08 - COVID Safety Report Issue 75 (23 September 2022)

Example of weekly COVID-19 vaccine safety report lacking Plan framework references, VSIG acknowledgement, or Strategy 2.3 methodology outputs despite being published during active rollout period.

#### FOI 4029-09 - Weekly COVID Vaccine Safety Report

Additional example of weekly safety report showing aggregate adverse event data without systematic tracking against Plan objectives or documented integration with enhanced monitoring strategies.

### Audit Significance

This complete FOI 4029 suite demonstrates:

1. **Planning occurred:** ACV endorsed enhanced strategies before rollout (4029-01)
2. **Methodologies existed:** TGA developed and presented Strategy 2.3 frameworks (4029-03)
3. **Internal processes operated:** VSIG meetings and signal investigations occurred (4029-05)
4. **Documentation capacity exists:** TGA routinely documents processes with work instructions (4029-06)
5. **Public reporting gap:** Safety reports lack Plan framework references despite internal use (4029-03, 08, 09)

The contrast between TGA's demonstrated capacity to document routine processes (4029-06) and organise Plan-framework materials for advisory bodies (4029-03) versus the absence of Plan implementation documentation for public accountability establishes the documentation gap as a policy choice rather than a capability limitation.

An official unredacted copy from TGA's FOI disclosure log is being sought. **Readers should verify critical details against official TGA sources.**

Third-party FOI request seeking monthly incidence data for conditions identified in the Comirnaty AusPAR as requiring monitoring under provisional approval. TGA response: "the documents you have requested do not exist...the TGA does not hold 'incidence data' related to cancer." Confirms that 3.5 years post-approval, condition-specific incidence data specified in TGA's own approval documents does not exist in accessible form, providing independent corroboration of Strategy 2.3 AIR-denominator implementation absence documented in this audit. Demonstrates gap between monitoring conditions specified in AusPARs and actual data collection/retention practices.

### TGA Pharmacovigilance – a regulator's perspective: Evidence of a Gap Between Promise and Practice 

### Source & Context

**Presenters:** Vicky Dong and Shabnam Sharan, Pharmacovigilance and Special Access Branch, TGA

**Event:** UTS "Molecule to Market" webinar series (Master of Pharmacy capstone subject)

**Date:** 13 October 2021 – during the peak provisional approval period (by which time ~68% of eventual doses had been administered)

**Purpose:** Formal professional education for future pharmacy professionals on TGA regulatory processes

**Source:** [Therapeutic Goods Administration, Pharmacovigilance – a regulator's perspective](webinar-presentation-pharmacovigilance-regulators-perspective.pdf) (webinar presentation, UTS "Molecule to Market", 13 October 2021)  

### Content Analysis

**Slide 22: "How the TGA does this?"** - Detailed routine PV infrastructure:
- Adverse Event Management System (AEMS) database
- Database of Adverse Event Notifications (DAEN)
- Daily review of serious adverse events
- Weekly analysis for some vaccines (e.g. influenza)
- Bimonthly Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR) analysis
- Safety issues tracked through workflow database

**Slide 23: "PV in the times of COVID-19"** - References Safety Plan and lists aspirational strategies:
- Timely collection and management of adverse event reports
- Timely detection and investigation of safety signals
- Timely action to address safety concerns
- Timely communications to inform the public
- Close collaboration with vaccine safety stakeholders

**Slide 24:** Weekly COVID-19 vaccine safety reports shown as output

**Pattern:** Detailed routine PV infrastructure presented (Slide 22), but COVID-19 slide (23) shows only aspirational strategies without operational distinction from that routine infrastructure.

### Key Fact: The Omission of AusVaxSafety

The February 2021 COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Monitoring Plan explicitly designated the AusVaxSafety active surveillance system as a cornerstone of "enhanced" monitoring, critical for proactive signal detection and differentiating it from routine passive surveillance.

However, in this October 2021 training—delivered eight months into the rollout by the branch responsible for pharmacovigilance—AusVaxSafety is not mentioned. Slide 23 of the presentation, which specifically addresses "PV in the times of COVID-19" and lists "key strategies of the plan," describes only passive surveillance systems (AEMS/DAEN) and routine signal detection processes.

### Significance of the Omission

This omission is not minor; it is evidence of a disconnect between the published Plan and operational reality.

**Difficult to reconcile with the Plan's framework:**  
The Plan's "enhanced" monitoring was premised on integrated active surveillance. Its absence from operational training suggests the promised differentiated system was not being communicated as functional to frontline health professionals.

**Prefigures later characterisation:**  
This 2021 portrayal of COVID-19 monitoring as functionally indistinguishable from routine processes is directly consistent with the 2025 Senate testimony describing it as "day-to-day processes" never shown to have been systematically tracked against the Plan.

**Corroborates the audit finding:**  
The inability to point to specific, documented enhanced monitoring outputs in 2025 is prefigured here. The training describes aspirational goals ("aiming to enhance") rather than the 20 specified operational outputs listed in the Plan. This aligns with the audit's core finding: the documented, systematic implementation of "enhanced" monitoring cannot be verified.

### Conclusion

The October 2021 teaching materials are contemporaneous evidence that TGA's own characterisation of its monitoring framework to professionals did not reflect the integrated, active surveillance system promised in the Safety Plan. This is not speculation on why AusVaxSafety was omitted; the omission itself is a documented fact that supports the wider pattern of evidence: a gap between the promised "enhanced" system and the verifiable, documented reality of its execution.
