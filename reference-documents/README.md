### TGA COVID‑19 Vaccine Safety Monitoring Plan (February 2021)

**File:** `TGA_COVID19_Vaccine_Safety_Monitoring_Plan_Feb2021.pdf`  

TGA’s published COVID‑19 Vaccine Safety Monitoring Plan (February 2021). This is the primary source document against which implementation was assessed.

The audit methodology mapped the Plan’s outputs against:

- TGA’s Australian Regulatory Guidelines for Prescription Medicines (ARGPM)  
- International pharmacovigilance standards (ICH E2E, CIOMS, EMA GVP Module I)  
- Commonwealth records‑management requirements (PGPA Act 2013, Archives Act 1983)

Provisional‑approval processes were benchmarked against comparable frameworks from:

- US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  
- European Medicines Agency (EMA)
