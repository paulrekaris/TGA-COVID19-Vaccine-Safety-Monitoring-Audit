**File:** TGA_COVID19_Vaccine_Safety_Monitoring_Plan_Feb2021.pdf

TGA's published COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Monitoring Plan (February 2021). This is the primary source document against which implementation was assessed.

The audit methodology mapped TGA's 24 plan outputs against:
- TGA's Australian Regulatory Guidelines for Prescription Medicines (ARGPM)
- International pharmacovigilance standards (ICH E2E, EMA GVP Module I)
- Commonwealth records management requirements (PGPA Act 2013, Archives Act 1983)

Provisional approval processes were benchmarked against comparable frameworks from:
- US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
- European Medicines Agency (EMA)
