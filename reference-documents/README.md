### Australian COVID‑19 Vaccination Policy 

  https://www.health.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/2020/11/australian-covid-19-vaccination-policy.docx  
  Commits the Australian Government to active and comprehensive post‑market safety monitoring for COVID‑19 vaccines and assigns adverse event monitoring “via the TGA” through a national COVID‑19 Vaccine Pharmacovigilance Plan.

### TGA COVID‑19 Vaccine Safety Monitoring Plan (February 2021)

TGA’s published COVID‑19 Vaccine Safety Monitoring Plan (February 2021). This is the primary source document against which implementation was assessed.

The audit methodology mapped the Plan’s outputs against:

- TGA’s Australian Regulatory Guidelines for Prescription Medicines (ARGPM)  
- International pharmacovigilance standards (ICH E2E, CIOMS, EMA GVP Module I)  
- Commonwealth records‑management requirements (PGPA Act 2013, Archives Act 1983)

Provisional‑approval processes were benchmarked against comparable frameworks from:

- US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  
- European Medicines Agency (EMA)

  > Active, SMS‑based post‑vaccination surveillance data for COVID‑19 vaccines in Australia, including cumulative counts of invitations sent, responses received, self‑reported adverse events and medical‑attendance rates. Used in this audit for estimates of approximately 6.8 million survey responses, ~3 million adverse‑event reports and ~62,000 reports of medical attention.

### Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee testimony transcript excerpts

### Australian Public Assessment Reports (AusPARs)

AusPARs documenting the transition of Comirnaty and Spikevax from provisional to full registration. These reports record TGA’s regulatory decisions and summarise clinical and safety data, and were reviewed for any evidence of verification against the February 2021 Safety Monitoring Plan or explicit sign‑off of enhanced‑monitoring conditions.
