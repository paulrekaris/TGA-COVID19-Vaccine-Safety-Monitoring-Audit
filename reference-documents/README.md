### TGA COVID‑19 Vaccine Safety Monitoring Plan (February 2021)

TGA’s published COVID‑19 Vaccine Safety Monitoring Plan (February 2021). This is the primary source document against which implementation was assessed.

The audit methodology mapped the Plan’s outputs against:

- TGA’s Australian Regulatory Guidelines for Prescription Medicines (ARGPM)  
- International pharmacovigilance standards (ICH E2E, CIOMS, EMA GVP Module I)  
- Commonwealth records‑management requirements (PGPA Act 2013, Archives Act 1983)

Provisional‑approval processes were benchmarked against comparable frameworks from:

- US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  
- European Medicines Agency (EMA)

  > Active, SMS‑based post‑vaccination surveillance data for COVID‑19 vaccines in Australia, including cumulative counts of invitations sent, responses received, self‑reported adverse events and medical‑attendance rates. Used in this audit for estimates of approximately 6.8 million survey responses, ~3 million adverse‑event reports and ~62,000 reports of medical attention.

### Victorian COVID-19 Vaccination Program Implementation Plan (19 February 2021)
Available at: <https://federalfinancialrelations.gov.au/sites/federalfinancialrelations.gov.au/files/2021-04/vic_vaccine_plan.pdf>

Formal bilateral agreement between Commonwealth and Victoria establishing governance framework for vaccine rollout. Demonstrates that COVID-19 vaccination program operated under structured intergovernmental agreements requiring formal implementation processes and documentation—reinforcing audit finding that enhanced monitoring was not routine business but required systematic framework with traceable records. This directly contradicts Senate testimony by senior TGA officials (9 October 2025) claiming monitoring was managed through "day-to-day processes" rather than systematic tracking against plan objectives.

### Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee testimony transcript excerpts

Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee testimony (9 October 2025) where TGA officials confirmed that implementation of the Safety Monitoring Plan was “never systematically tracked” by Plan objective, described monitoring as “day‑to‑day processes”, and reported 148 signals investigated and 57 regulatory actions.

### Key Content

**On the COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Monitoring Plan (Slide 23):**

TGA officials described the Plan as:
- **"Aiming to enhance"** rapid detection, investigation and response to suspected adverse events following COVID immunisation
- Having **"five defined key strategies"** including timely collection, detection, action, communication, and stakeholder collaboration
- Framework designed to maintain "public confidence in the immunisation program"

**On routine pharmacovigilance systems:**
- Detailed AEMS (Adverse Event Management System) database operations
- Standard signal detection processes (daily serious event review, bimonthly PRR analysis)
- PSUR review procedures
- Sponsor reporting requirements
- Risk Management Plan evaluation

**Notable omissions:**

When describing COVID-19 vaccine safety monitoring to pharmacy students (Slide 23), TGA officials:

- ✗ **No mention of AusVaxSafety active surveillance system** - Despite being prominently featured in the February 2021 Safety Plan as a cornerstone of enhanced monitoring, including SMS-based systematic adverse event collection, real-time safety signal detection, and provision of denominator data
- ✗ No reference to the 20 specific enhanced monitoring outputs detailed in the Safety Plan
- ✗ No description of enhanced monitoring as distinct from routine pharmacovigilance processes  
- ✗ No mention of active surveillance methods differentiating COVID-19 monitoring from standard passive reporting

**Significance of AusVaxSafety omission:**

The February 2021 Safety Plan explicitly relied on AusVaxSafety to provide:
- Active surveillance (not passive spontaneous reporting)
- Systematic data collection via SMS monitoring
- Real-time adverse event monitoring
- Denominator data for rate calculations
- Proactive signal detection capability

By October 2021:
- AusVaxSafety should have been fully operational for 8 months
- Approximately 68% of eventual vaccine doses had been administered
- The system should have been generating regular reports and data
- It represented a key distinction between "routine" and "enhanced" monitoring

When teaching pharmacy students how TGA's COVID-19 vaccine safety monitoring works, officials responsible for pharmacovigilance describe only passive surveillance (AEMS/DAEN) and routine signal detection processes—not the active surveillance system featured in the Plan.

This is consistent with either:
1. AusVaxSafety not functioning as specified in the Plan, OR
2. AusVaxSafety data not integrated into TGA monitoring as described, OR  
3. Specified outputs from AusVaxSafety not being produced/documented

All three scenarios align with the audit finding that enhanced monitoring outputs cannot be verified through documentary evidence.

### Significance

**Teaching context:**

This was not a media statement, political communication, or defensive response to criticism. This was **formal professional education** by officials responsible for vaccine safety monitoring, teaching future pharmacy professionals how TGA's regulatory systems work.

**Timing:**

Delivered 8 months into the vaccine rollout, when:
- 68% of eventual doses already administered
- Enhanced monitoring should have been fully operational
- Multiple specified outputs (weekly reports, monthly analyses, quarterly reviews) should have been produced

**Characterization of the Safety Plan:**

Officials described the Plan using:
- **Aspirational language:** "aims at enhancing" (future-oriented)
- **Strategic objectives:** Five general goals
- **No operational specifics:** No mention of the 20 specified outputs, their frequencies, or deliverables

This contrasts with describing routine PV systems (AEMS, signal detection, PSUR review) in concrete, operational terms.

**Omission of AusVaxSafety:**

The February 2021 Safety Plan prominently featured AusVaxSafety active surveillance as a cornerstone of enhanced monitoring. When teaching students how COVID-19 vaccine safety monitoring works, officials do not mention it. This omission is significant because AusVaxSafety represented the primary distinction between "routine" passive surveillance and "enhanced" active monitoring—without it, COVID-19 monitoring would be indistinguishable from standard pharmacovigilance.

**Contrast with October 2025 Senate testimony:**

Four years later, senior TGA officials would characterize the monitoring as "day-to-day processes" that were never systematically tracked or documented. The UTS presentation shows officials in October 2021 already describing the Plan in aspirational rather than operational terms—consistent with the later testimony that specified outputs were not produced.

**Educational accountability:**

Pharmacy professionals were taught that TGA had a structured framework "aiming to enhance" COVID-19 vaccine safety monitoring. The absence of implementation records raises questions about the gap between what was taught and what was actually implemented and documented.

### Relevance to Audit

This presentation provides contemporaneous evidence of how TGA officials responsible for pharmacovigilance characterized the COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Monitoring Plan during the rollout:

1. **Aspirational framing:** Described as "aiming to enhance" rather than "producing specified outputs"
2. **Strategic objectives:** Five general goals rather than 20 concrete deliverables  
3. **Omission of key components:** No mention of AusVaxSafety or specific enhanced monitoring activities
4. **Routine vs. enhanced:** Detailed description of routine PV systems, aspirational description of COVID-19 enhancements

This is consistent with the audit finding that the 20 specified enhanced monitoring outputs cannot be verified through documentary evidence—officials teaching about the monitoring framework in October 2021 describe aims and strategies, not operational outputs.
