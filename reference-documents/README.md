### Australian COVID‑19 Vaccination Policy (November 2020)

  Commits the Australian Government to active and comprehensive post‑market safety monitoring for COVID‑19 vaccines and assigns adverse event monitoring “via the TGA” through a national COVID‑19 Vaccine Pharmacovigilance Plan.

### TGA COVID‑19 Vaccine Safety Monitoring Plan (February 2021)

TGA’s published COVID‑19 Vaccine Safety Monitoring Plan (February 2021). This is the primary source document against which implementation was assessed.

The audit methodology mapped the Plan’s outputs against:

- TGA’s Australian Regulatory Guidelines for Prescription Medicines (ARGPM)  
- International pharmacovigilance standards (ICH E2E, CIOMS, EMA GVP Module I)  
- Commonwealth records‑management requirements (PGPA Act 2013, Archives Act 1983)

Provisional‑approval processes were benchmarked against comparable frameworks from:

- US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  
- European Medicines Agency (EMA)

### AusVaxSafety – Active and enhanced vaccine safety surveillance for COVID‑19 vaccines in Australia (February 2021)

  https://www.ausvaxsafety.org.au/active-and-enhanced-vaccine-safety-surveillance-covid-19-vaccines-australia  
  Describes AusVaxSafety as operating “as part of the national COVID‑19 Vaccine Pharmacovigilance Plan, led by the TGA and the Australian Government”, complementing TGA and state/territory spontaneous reporting systems.

  > Active, SMS‑based post‑vaccination surveillance data for COVID‑19 vaccines in Australia, including cumulative counts of invitations sent, responses received, self‑reported adverse events and medical‑attendance rates. Used in this audit for estimates of approximately 6.8 million survey responses, ~3 million adverse‑event reports and ~62,000 reports of medical attention.

### Victorian COVID-19 Vaccination Program Implementation Plan (19 February 2021)
Available at: <https://federalfinancialrelations.gov.au/sites/federalfinancialrelations.gov.au/files/2021-04/vic_vaccine_plan.pdf>

Formal bilateral agreement between Commonwealth and Victoria establishing governance framework for vaccine rollout. Demonstrates that COVID-19 vaccination program operated under structured intergovernmental agreements requiring formal implementation processes and documentation—reinforcing audit finding that enhanced monitoring was not routine business but required systematic framework with traceable records. This directly contradicts Senate testimony by senior TGA officials (9 October 2025) claiming monitoring was managed through "day-to-day processes" rather than systematic tracking against plan objectives.

### Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee testimony transcript excerpts

Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee testimony (9 October 2025) where TGA officials confirmed that implementation of the Safety Monitoring Plan was “never systematically tracked” by Plan objective, described monitoring as “day‑to‑day processes”, and reported 148 signals investigated and 57 regulatory actions.

### Australian Public Assessment Reports (AusPARs)

AusPARs documenting the transition of Comirnaty and Spikevax from provisional to full registration. These reports record TGA’s regulatory decisions and summarise clinical and safety data, and were reviewed for any evidence of verification against the February 2021 Safety Monitoring Plan or explicit sign‑off of enhanced‑monitoring conditions.

### TGA performance reports

TGA corporate performance reports reviewed to identify any Plan‑related outputs, indicators or performance measures. These documents provide the official performance‑reporting context against which the absence of Safety Monitoring Plan implementation metrics is assessed.

## TGA Pharmacovigilance Teaching Materials (October 2021)

**File:** `webinar-presentation-pharmacovigilance-regulators-perspective.pdf`

**Source:** Therapeutic Goods Administration, *Pharmacovigilance – a regulator's perspective* (webinar presentation, UTS "Molecule to Market", 13 October 2021)

**Link:** https://www.tga.gov.au/sites/default/files/webinar-presentation-pharmacovigilance-regulators-perspective.pdf

**Key points:**

- TGA teaching materials prepared during peak provisional approval period (October 2021) for regulatory training at UTS
- Describes COVID-19 Vaccine Safety Monitoring Plan as the "overarching framework" for "enhanced" COVID-19 vaccine safety monitoring
- Presents structured system supported by AEFI reporting channels, workflow databases and Adverse Event Management System
- Contemporaneous representation contrasts with October 2024 Senate testimony describing "day-to-day processes" never systematically tracked
- Official TGA materials used for external regulatory education and stakeholder engagement

**Significance:** Demonstrates TGA's own public characterization of the Safety Monitoring Plan as a structured governance framework during the rollout period, raising questions about the contradiction with later testimony and absence of implementation records.
